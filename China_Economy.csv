People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Zhong Wenxing",Economy,20240628,1649,,,China ramps up financial support for SMEs to spur economic vitality,"BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China has significantly enhanced financial support measures aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to boost economic vitality.
There has been a notable increase in the cap for inclusive micro and small loans from 10 million yuan (about 1.4 million U.S. dollars) to 20 million yuan per borrower, and refinancing initiatives for agricultural and small businesses have seen interest rate reductions, further alleviating financial burdens on these crucial economic entities.
At the end of May, the outstanding inclusive micro and small loans amounted to 31.56 trillion yuan, marking a 19.3 percent year-on-year increase.
In April, China set up a re-lending program worth 500 billion yuan to promote technological innovation and industrial upgrades, with 100 billion yuan specially designated to help boost the growth of tech firms.
An initial list of nearly 7,000 qualified enterprises under the program was sent to banks recently.
""We immediately reviewed the credit and business needs of relevant clients upon receiving the list,"" said Zhang Xiaorui, deputy head of the Shandong branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The bank has established green channels and streamlined services to ensure businesses receive the funds timely.
One such beneficiary, an electromechanical company in Yantai in east China's Shandong Province, completed the process for its 1-million-yuan loan within one day, effectively easing its cash flow pressures.
The challenges SMEs face in accessing affordable financing often stem from their insufficient collateral and vulnerability to risks. To address this problem, Chinese lenders have leveraged digital technologies to reduce risks and offer tailored services to SMEs.
Despite lacking tangible assets suitable for traditional collateral, a manufacturer of high-performance engineering plastics in east China's Zhejiang Province recently secured a 2 million yuan credit line from Zhejiang E-Commerce Bank. The bank made the decision to grant the loan after using advanced data analytics to evaluate industry chain dynamics and operational risks.
According to Chen Kai, vice general manager of the bank's industry finance department, nearly 30 percent of the credit recipients were involved in pioneering scientific research and technological development.
This data-driven lending approach has been adopted by many other banks in China. The Export-Import Bank of China has used big data on trade to tailor online products for micro and small businesses engaged in international trade. The ICBC and the Bank of China have launched technology finance centers to bolster support for technology-driven SMEs.
Apart from bank loans, China also encourages SMEs to take advantage of direct financing channels, including the capital market and venture capital (VC) investment.
The government recently released a string of policies to bolster VC investment, with specific measures to support the growth of SMEs through patent industrialization. Such equity financing is better suited to spur innovation activities during the high-risk research and development phase, said Zhou Guanping, a researcher at China Everbright Group.
The Beijing Stock Exchange, established in November 2021, is also dedicated to serving innovative SMEs.
Among the 249 listed companies on the exchange, SMEs account for over 80 percent, underscoring the pivotal role of public equity markets in fostering innovation and expansion among SMEs. The total capitalization of the exchange has surpassed 330 billion yuan.
In addition to enhanced financing channels for SMEs, experts have also called for more efforts to ensure that the financing is more sound and sustainable.
Hou Liming, a researcher at the Renmin University of China, said that work should be done to further reduce the liquidity pressure of SMEs due to delinquent receivables, promote their digitalization, and launch more insurance products targeting SME risks.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Zhong Wenxing",Economy,20240628,1624,,,China remains key driving force for global economic growth,"DALIAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Despite the world grappling with a slowdown in economic growth and a challenging recovery, China's economy has maintained steady development, bolstered by the rise of new industries and new growth drivers.
During the 15th Annual Meeting of the New Champions, also known as the 2024 Summer Davos, which concluded on Thursday, participants hailed China's efforts in cultivating new quality productive forces, noting that it has not only injected new vitality into the Chinese economy but also expanded opportunities for global cooperation.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that China's contribution to world economic growth has stayed at around 30 percent over the years, and it continues to be a key driving force for global economic growth.
NEW GROWTH DRIVERS
Since the start of this year, the Chinese economy has maintained its recovery momentum. It started strongly in the first quarter with a 5.3 percent year-on-year growth and continued to grow steadily in the second quarter.
Official data showed that indicators measuring consumption, trade in goods and value-added industrial output all posted positive performance in May.
""We have the confidence and capability to achieve the growth target of around 5 percent for this year,"" Chinese Premier Li Qiang said when addressing the opening plenary of the event.
International organizations and institutions have raised their forecasts for China's economic growth, reflecting strong confidence in the country's future prospects.
Recently, the World Bank increased its forecast for China's 2024 economic growth to 4.8 percent, 0.3 percentage points higher than the previous forecast. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also revised China's economic outlook to 5 percent, 0.4 percentage points higher than the previous forecast.
This positive outlook rebuffs the narratives of some Western politicians and media, who claimed that China's economic slowdown could pose risks to global economic growth. According to IMF analysis, a 1 percentage point increase in China's GDP growth results in an average of 0.3 percentage point increase in growth for other economies.
China's economy has exceeded expectations and shown strong resilience in the first half of this year, especially in emerging industries, Jason Ding, managing partner of Greater China offices with Bain & Company told Xinhua.
In particular, China has gained an international edge in electric vehicles, lithium batteries and photovoltaics. Renewable energy now accounts for over 50 percent of the country's total installed capacity.
""I see huge opportunities in China since it is leading the way in a series of new technologies such as the batteries and new energy vehicles, which have provided new drivers of growth,"" said Merik Dusek, the managing director of the World Economic Forum.
""High-quality growth"" is more than just a popular buzzword, said Peng Sen, president of the China Society of Economic Reform. ""This is about advanced productivity and innovation.""
Future growth for China's industries requires a revolutionary transformation on the technological front, as well as a focus on cutting-edge technologies such as generative AI and advanced chips, he added.
OPENING UP ENDEAVOUR
Amid a gloomy global economic outlook, China's sustained economic growth promises positive spillover effects for the rest of the world.
At present, China is a major trading partner of over 140 countries and regions. In the first five months of this year, its trade in goods with other countries grew by 6.3 percent year on year, according to official statistics.
China has a vast market of over 1.4 billion people, a comprehensive industrial support system, an abundant labor force and talent pool, and diverse application scenarios, said Jason Ding, adding that these unique advantages could not only meet domestic demand but also enhance supply in the international market.
For example, the country's cultivation of large-scale new growth drivers in sectors such as green infrastructure, green energy, green transportation and green lifestyle will generate investment and consumption markets with an estimated size of 10 trillion yuan (about 1.4 trillion U.S. dollars) annually, promising enormous potential.
Emphasizing the fundamentally global nature of these new technologies, Keyu Jin, a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science said, ""China might be leading the way in EVs, batteries and solar panels, but they are all embedded in a global supply chain. It's going to involve everybody.""
In contrast to some countries resorting to regressive actions like decoupling, disrupting supply chains and building barriers, China has reaffirmed its commitment to opening its doors wider to the world and deepening cooperation with international communities.
In his speech, Premier Li Qiang called on all countries and regions to work toward deepening scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation, bolster the foundation for green development, safeguard an open market environment, and promote inclusive and mutually beneficial development.
China remains steadfast in its commitment to opening up. It has pledged to increase imports of high-quality goods and services from all over the world, attract increased foreign investment in sectors such as medium and high-end manufacturing and biopharmaceuticals, further streamline market access, and foster an open, inclusive and transparent business environment for enterprises worldwide.
""We definitely need to keep China open for the world, but we also need to keep the world open for China,"" Jin added.

People.cn,"Hongyu, Liang Jun",Economy,20240628,1513,,,"Footwear industry in Putian, SE China's Fujian marches toward high-quality development","In Putian city, southeast China's Fujian Province, shoemaking is not only a way of making a living but also a time-honored craft that has been handed down through generations.
In 2023, the Putian footwear and clothing industry reached an output value of around 140 billion yuan ($19.28 billion). The city, once renowned as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) shoemaking base, has lived up to its reputation with its mature technology and well-established industrial chains.
In Putian, over 1.6 billion pairs of shoes are manufactured each year. The city is home to over 4,000 footwear and clothing enterprises, with 423 companies above designated size. Over 500,000 people are engaged in the industry in the city.
In the last century, Putian's shoemaking industry became a major player in OEM production due to its technological and equipment advantages. Putian remained at the cutting edge of shoemaking technology due to the continuous influx of orders from international brands. Over time, it has evolved into an industrial cluster with world-class productivity and scale.

Zhu Huijuan, quality manager of Fujian Zhongyu New Materials Technology Co., Ltd., explained that before being used in sports shoes, the shoe leather undergoes over 200 chemical safety performance tests and over 80 physical performance tests.
Records show Putian's footwear and clothing industry boasts 53 national high-tech enterprises, one national enterprise technology center, two national industrial design centers, and 21 provincial-level enterprises that utilize special and sophisticated technologies to produce innovative and unique products. Furthermore, this industry has participated in the development of 27 national footwear standards.
Shoes manufactured in Putian go beyond national standards with their outstanding folding resistance, capable of enduring 50,000 continuous folds without any separation between the upper and sole. Moreover, they demonstrate numerous performance qualities that greatly surpass national benchmarks.

In Putian, there are textile factories that can turn 125 grams of used clothes into a pair of shoe uppers and enterprises that utilize supercritical foam materials to create shoe soles that are high-performance, eco-friendly, and lightweight. These soles save around 35 percent on materials, and improve performance by 30 percent.
Putian's footwear industry owes its success to its cutting-edge research and development (R&D) capabilities.
""There is a new materials enterprise with a core R&D team made up entirely of high school graduates. These people have developed cutting-edge material technologies that have left even textile professors in awe,"" said Li Zhenhai, deputy mayor of Xianyou county, Putian.

According to Li, artificial intelligence (AI) offers significant advantages in collecting and analyzing consumer habits. In fact, nearly 70 enterprises above designated size in Xianyou county have been utilizing AI in their design processes for several years.
More than 10 years ago, Guo Jing founded Putian Qingchunzhijia Sports Goods Co., Ltd. Since then, the company's brands have flourished with over 100 patents, establishing themselves in the mid-to-high-end market.
""We stamp every pair of shoes with the mark 'Made in PT China,' ensuring that consumers are aware of their origin in Putian,"" Guo said.

In Xianyou county, the government has provided robust support for the footwear industry in terms of e-commerce channels. Even before the rise of live-streaming sales, the local government had introduced several e-commerce bases.
Li said the introduction of e-commerce platforms has brought reliable partners to the local footwear industry and taught companies how to leverage e-commerce effectively. With the support of e-commerce, some shoe companies in the county can sell 10,000 pairs of shoes in a single day.

The 15th Annual Meeting of the New Champions (AMNC24), also known as the Summer Davos, wrapped up on Thursday with officials, economists, and business leaders from around the world concluding their three-day discussion covering topics spanning from technology, economics, and geopolitics and highlighting China's key role in driving the global economic growth.
At the event, Chinese and international business leaders and scholars hailed ""certainties"" from China amid a turbulent world and highlighted China's critical role in helping address growing challenges, including the global economic downturn.
The AMNC24, featuring the theme ""Next Frontiers for Growth,"" concluded on Thursday in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning Province. It drew the attendance of over 1,600 participants from business, government, civil society, international organizations, and academia from about 80 countries and regions.
As one of the most important international economy-themed forums, the Summer Davos offered the world an opportunity to better understand important trends across various fields, Hu Qimu, a deputy secretary-general of the Digital-Real Economies Integration Forum 50, told the Global Times on Thursday, noting that hot topics during the forum are more likely to become key elements that steer the world's economy growth.
Compared with the first two days' spotlight on specific discussions addressing artificial intelligence (AI), climate change, food, and energy security, panels held on the third day - Thursday - attached more importance to how China could drive the world forward.
Peng Sen, president of China Society of Economic Reform, said on Thursday during a panel discussion named ""China Economic Outlook"" that China's economy achieved a growth rate of 5.2 percent in 2023, contributing around 30 percent to global growth despite significant pressure, and the growth rate hit a remarkable 5.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024, beyond expectation.
""I'm fully confident that China can achieve its GDP growth goal of around 5 percent. We need high-quality growth in order to stimulate our development and our growth. This depends on the transition, the revolutionary transformation, on the technological front, and as for the traditional sectors, they need an upgrade and they need a deep transformation,"" Peng said.
Jin Keyu, professor of economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science, said on Thursday at the forum that China is spearheading the structural transformation via electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels, which was much earlier than most Western economies, adding that China will play an essential role in the global green transition.
Jin noted that ""trillions of dollars of investment is needed"" for the global green transition, adding that ""China is going to play a very essential role"" in the transformation.
She highlighted that China's new innovative business models, and the digital economy, accounting for about 40 percent of the country's GDP, are a practical and cost-effective solution to many developing countries' present problems.
When Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the opening plenary of the Summer Davos, he emphasized that China has unique comparative advantages to foster new industries, including an ultra-large market with a population of over 1.4 billion, a complete industrial system, abundant human resources, diverse application scenarios, and consumers' high acceptance of new technologies.
""We have the confidence and capability to achieve the growth target of around 5 percent for this year,"" Li said.
In terms of trade and technology protectionism signs in multilateral cooperation, Premier Li stressed that China will promote inclusive and mutually beneficial development, which was hailed by experts attending the AMNC24.
Following a panel discussion theme with ""US-China Relations Analyzed,"" Li Cheng, professor of political science from the University of Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Thursday that China-US technology cooperation witnessed a rapid falloff over the past few years due to US policies targeting China.
Premier Li said that if countries only think about maximizing their own interests without considering that of others, and even turn back the wheel of history by decoupling and cutting off industrial and supply chains with the ""small yard and high fence"" policy, it will only raise the cost of global economic operations, sever economic ties between regions and intensify contradictions and disputes.
""China has world-leading scientists and engineers, and US' protectionism and bias may force them back to China and other Asian countries. It is actually not in line with US' interests,"" Li Cheng noted.
In order to set a stable foundation for economic growth and avoid the impact of global uncertainty, China will foster new quality productive forces by launching a series of key projects covering AI, integrated circuits, and global computing power network to empower traditional technologies, Peng said.
China has seen a steady economic performance so far in 2024, with the country's retail sales of consumer goods hitting 19.52 trillion yuan ($2.69 trillion) from January to May this year, up 4.1 percent year-on-year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
Hu noted that China might be the only economy that can drive the world out of its current whirlpool of decline in a peaceful and moderate way.
""The reason why China-related topics are so important and attract much attention is because the world is looking for certainties in China amid soaring global uncertainties,"" Hu said.
China's economic growth in the second half of 2024 is also a major topic underlined by AMNC24 participants, as Peng noted that stable growth in China will be good news for the world.
""Currently, there are still some challenges facing China's economy, including unreleased domestic consumption potential and global uncertainties. But the country's economy can be greatly boosted through countercyclical policies and new growth momentum generated from new quality productive forces,"" said Peng.
Regarding the coming third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee scheduled to be held in July in Beijing, Peng projected that there will be more macro-related policies to be released.
Li Cheng said that aside from economic stimulus, China has vast room for conducting urbanization and it might be a new growth engine for China.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Zhong Wenxing",Economy,20240628,1422,,,Macao SAR gov't thanks central gov't for new duty-free measures,"MACAO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive Ho Iat Seng expressed gratitude on Friday on behalf of the Macao SAR government for the central government's newly introduced measures to increase duty-free allowance for personal luggage items brought in from Macao to the Chinese Mainland.
He pointed out that the new measures would stimulate tourism consumption growth and benefit more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Macao, injecting new momentum into the SAR's overall economic development.
A notice jointly released by the Ministry of Finance, the General Administration of Customs and State Taxation Administration said the new policy will apply to adult residents and visitors entering from Hong Kong and Macao whose personal belongings obtained overseas have a total value of no more than 12,000 yuan (about 1,683.8 U.S. dollars).
At ports with duty-free shops, the cap will be raised to 15,000 yuan, the notice said.
Ho remarked that this is an important measure taken by the central government in response to the demands of Macao society, once again demonstrating the central government's attention and care for Macao.
He added that the increase in the duty-free allowance would help promote tourism consumption growth and boost the local economy. This will benefit SMEs, including the retail sector, and aid the steady forward development of the overall economy of the Macao SAR.
Ho emphasized that the SAR government will continue to work hand in hand with all sectors of society to effectively implement the series of measures introduced by the central government, making the international metropolis of Macao's ""golden name card"" shine even brighter in gratitude for the central government's care and support.

The recent decision by rating agency S&P Global Ratings to maintain China's sovereign credit rating at ""A+"" with a stable outlook reflects a positive recognition of China's economic resilience and growth prospects, the Ministry of Finance said on Thursday.
The positive assessment by S&P along with the recent upward revision from other global institutions, underscores the resilience and growth potential of China's economy, experts said.
The decision of S&P to maintain China's credit rating was based on a thorough assessment of the country's macroeconomic growth and development outlook, according to a senior official from the Ministry of Finance.
The rating agency conducted in-depth discussions with Chinese government departments think tanks, market institutions, and local authorities, providing a solid foundation for an objective assessment, the official said.
S&P pointed out that despite some challenges, China's economy continues to grow steadily, supported by the effective implementation of macroeconomic policies. China's large market size, strong domestic demand, a solid development foundation, new growth drivers, and abundant resources are key strengths, the official said.
Additionally, the Chinese government's efforts to optimize macroeconomic policies and strengthen counter-cyclical adjustments will further enhance the country's internal development momentum, the official added.
The S&P rating is objective and fair as China's economy is currently on a stable growth trajectory, dismissing any unfounded concerns over debt risks, Pan Helin, a Beijing-based veteran economist, told the Global Times on Thursday.
""This impartial rating highlights S&P's confidence in China's economic stability and resilience, serving as strong proof and reflecting the rating agency's recognition of the country's economic accomplishments over recent years,"" Pan said.
Looking ahead, China's economic prospects primarily hinge on technological innovation. Key strategies include manufacturing transformation and advancement from low-end to high-end production to establish a competitive edge in Chinese industries, Pan said.
Pan emphasized that the future focus of China's economic growth on enhancing the service sector, particularly in high-value segments like technology services, financial services, and the platform economy, will further increase its contribution to China's economic framework.
The S&P's ratings were released following recent upward revisions of China's economic growth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
The IMF on May 29 announced an upward revision of its forecast for China's GDP growth in 2024 and 2025, citing strong GDP data in the first quarter and policy measures, further adding to a growing number of optimistic signs that the Chinese economy remains on a solid track toward recovery.
In a report issued on June 14, the World Bank revised China's GDP forecast to 4.8 percent, up 0.3 percentage points from its previous forecast in December. The revision was made due to stronger-than-expected export expectations and recent measures to support property markets.
China's economy continued expanding in May, with the output of industrial enterprises above the designated size up by 5.6 percent year-on-year, while retail sales rose by 3.7 percent, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.
Data showed that the world's second-largest economy sustained the recovery momentum from the first quarter and is on a firm trajectory to hit the goal of 5 percent GDP growth in 2024, experts said.
It is expected that future policies will focus on stabilizing the real estate market and expanding domestic demand to consolidate and enhance the nation's economic recovery, Wu Chaoming, a deputy head of the Chasing Research Institute, told the Global Times on Thursday.
It is estimated that China's GDP will grow by around 5.3 percent in the second quarter and around 5.1 percent for the whole year, he added.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Zhong Wenxing",Economy,20240628,1324,,,British businesses should maintain confidence in Chinese growth: business leaders,"LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- ""We tend to focus more on the changes as outsiders, but when you're doing business in China, I'm often struck by the continuity rather than the changes,"" said Julian Fisher, chair of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, on Wednesday.
At an event cohosted by the chamber on the topic of the next British government's strategy for China, many British business leaders expressed optimism about China's growth, acknowledging the opportunities despite certain difficulties.
St. John Moore, head of Beijing at Brunswick Group said, ""While China's growth may be slower than a few years ago, the market continues to present notable opportunities.""
""It is a market that is still growing, with a GDP of nearly USD 18 trillion last year, adding an economy the size of a mid-size country in a single year,"" he said.
Fisher also highlighted China's closer partnerships with countries in the South through the Belt and Road Initiative as an indication of its economic potential.
""I visited Uzbekistan a month ago and saw a Chinese construction of a hydropower station that can benefit over 20,000 local people,"" Fisher said.
When asked what the business community expects from the next British government's China strategy, Trey McArver, co-founder of China-focused consultancy Trivium China, said the community is hoping for a constructive relationship that reflects a more balanced tone in discussions about China.
""It's in the ultimate interest of the UK to have economic engagement with China. We cannot simply walk away and stand on particular values,"" Moore added.
All attendees agreed that the next British government should engage in informed dialogue with the business community and consider the tone when speaking about China.
""Having worked with businesses operating in China for the past 15 years, what strikes me most is how companies are more focused on policy changes coming from the United States and Europe rather than China, which is clear on its policy goals,"" McArver noted.

Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), the U.S. Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, peaked at 7.1 percent in mid-2022, the highest level since the early 1980s. PCE inflation was 2.7 percent in April and is expected to return to 2 percent by mid-2025, according to the concluding statement.
IMF staff, however, noted that there are important upside risks to the outlook for inflation. The expected decline in shelter inflation may materialize more slowly, or reverse more quickly, than expected. Also, even with the sizable expansion in labor supply, nominal wage growth remains relatively high, which could forestall the expected softening of non-shelter services inflation.
An escalation of geopolitical tensions could add to energy costs which would subsequently pass-through to wages and core inflation, IMF staff added.
On fiscal policy, IMF staff argued that the U.S. fiscal deficit is too large, ""creating a sustained upward trajectory for the public debt-GDP ratio.""
""Such high deficits and debt create a growing risk to the U.S. and global economy, potentially feeding into higher fiscal financing costs and a growing risk to the smooth rollover of maturing obligations,"" IMF staff said.
While the economy is showing a better overall balance, there are risks ahead to financial stability and from the ongoing increase in trade and subsidy distortions, IMF staff noted.
Financial stability risks have diminished since the time of the 2023 Article IV consultation and some critical financial sector reforms are being implemented, IMF staff said.
However, concrete actions have been lacking in mitigating the banking system vulnerabilities that came to light in 2023 -- including failings in bank supervision, the large share of uninsured deposits, and the risks created by the regulatory ""tailoring"" that was undertaken in 2018, they continued.
On trade, IMF staff argued that ""the ongoing intensification of trade restrictions and the increased use of preferences in the treatment of domestic versus foreign commercial interests represent a growing downside risk for both the U.S. and the global economy.""
""Tariffs, nontariff barriers, and domestic content provisions are not the right solutions since they distort trade and investment flows and risk creating a slippery slope that undermines the multilateral trading system, fragments global supply chains, and spurs retaliatory actions by trading partners,"" they continued.
""These policies are ultimately bad for U.S. growth, productivity, and labor market outcomes and the evidence suggests their costs are largely borne by U.S. consumers and firms,"" they added.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Economy,20240628,1102,,,Feature: Chinese solar products popular among Kenyans at expo,"NAIROBI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Edwin Kaleye keenly listened to presentations by sales representatives at the Dahai Solar booth during the ninth Solar Africa 2024 exhibition launched Wednesday in Nairobi, Kenya. As a high school teacher, he sought to purchase a solar home lighting solution for his rural home in eastern Kenya, which remains unconnected to the national electricity grid.
""I am looking for a reliable and affordable source of electricity to power my electric gadgets in my countryside house,"" Kaleye said. He expressed his admiration for Chinese solar technology, noting that it offers a viable alternative to electricity supplied by the national utility company.
With his rural home enjoying abundant sunshine year-round, Kaleye anticipated significant savings by using solar power. For about 110,000 Kenyan shillings (about 850 U.S. dollars), he could acquire a complete solar lighting system, enabling him to enjoy modern electronics similar to those in the city.
More than 30 Chinese manufacturers dedicated to solar products participated in the three-day expo, showcasing innovations to convert sunshine into electric energy.
Another visitor, outdoor enthusiast Derick Mbeya, was impressed by the solutions at the Shenzhen GT Powertank stand. The 31-year-old decided to purchase a portable solar battery solution for 740 dollars, ideal for his camping trips.
Michael Long, the sales manager for the Middle East and North Africa at Shenzhen Megarevo Technology, said that his company has developed solar solutions customized for African climatic conditions.
""Through research, we have developed solar technologies with high energy yields even in low light conditions,"" he said.
Benson Mangela, who runs a small hospital in central Kenya, visited the exhibition to purchase a solar system that offers a stable energy supply throughout the year as his facility often experiences service interruptions due to regular power blackouts.
Currently relying on a diesel generator during power cuts, he seeks to switch to solar to reduce operational costs. ""I typically spend more than 8,000 Kenyan shillings per day on fuel for the generators, which also suffer from breakdowns due to heavy usage,"" he said.
Mangela decided to invest in a 200 kW solar system with batteries and inverters from Shenzhen Megarevo Technology, which promises a return on investment in less than three years.

China and the European Union are expediting consultations on the latter's anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles, and aim to reach a mutually acceptable solution by addressing the reasonable concerns of both sides, said China's Ministry of Commerce on Thursday.
As China and the EU agreed last week to start consultations, He Yadong, spokesman for the Commerce Ministry, said the essence of China-EU cooperation lies in complementary advantages and mutual benefits. Both sides have vast potential for collaboration in the field of green transition.
He said the EU is encouraged to work with China to expedite consultations, achieve positive progress, and reach mutually acceptable solutions to prevent trade frictions from escalating, which could affect China-EU economic and trade relations.
Even though Chinese EVs account for just a small share of the EU's EV imports, the European Commission, which represents the interests of the EU as a whole, in mid-June unveiled additional provisional tariffs ranging from 17.4 percent to 38.1 percent for Chinese EV manufacturers despite widespread market concerns and China's objections.
Additional provisional EU duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese-made EVs are scheduled to take effect by July 4, with the tariffs expected to be finalized on Nov 2.
With some time remaining before the EU's final decision on imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs, government officials and business leaders said that initiating talks can be an effective approach to prevent further escalation and resolve differences.
During his meeting with Chinese Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao in Beijing on Wednesday, Wille Rydman, Finnish minister of economic affairs, said both the EU and China have successful experience in resolving trade and economic disputes, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement released on Thursday.
Finland supports addressing differences through dialogue and consultation within the framework of World Trade Organization rules, said Rydman.
Cui Fan, a professor specializing in international trade at the University of International Business and Economics and director of research at the China Society for WTO Studies, said that globally, the development of new energy in various countries involves some level of policy intervention to address market imperfections.
Relying solely on market forces could take 20-30 years longer to develop the new energy industry, which is inconsistent with the pace of global green transformation. China's supportive policies in this sector are scientifically based and comply with WTO rules, said Cui.
Jin Ruiting, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Macroeconomic Research under the National Development and Reform Commission, said currently the US still offers subsidies to support the construction of vehicle charging facilities within the country.
Peter Merker, director of the German Chamber of Commerce in China for Tianjin, said that sanctions as a tool have significant side effects.
Merker, who is also CEO of Schlote Tianjin, a subsidiary of German industrial parts manufacturer Schlote Group, said the automotive industry strongly opposes tariff increases and sanctions, and most ordinary people share that view.
China-EU trade declined 1.3 percent year-on-year to 2.23 trillion yuan ($307 billion) in the first five months, statistics from the General Administration of Customs showed.
The Ministry of Commerce also announced on Thursday that it will initiate an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures on imports of toluidine from the EU. Toluidine is a chemical used in the production of dyes, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides.
In response to an application from the domestic toluidine industry, the ministry has decided to initiate this expiry review probe, effective from Friday, said the ministry in an online notice.
This investigation will commence on Friday and conclude by June 28, 2025.

Peng Sen (center), president of the China Society of Economic Reform, speaks on Thursday at a subforum themed on China's economic outlook at the 15th Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Dalian, Liaoning province. (ZOU HONG/CHINA DAILY)
China is poised to meet its annual growth target of around 5 percent this year, given strong policy stimulus and the gradual recovery in confidence and expectations, experts and global entrepreneurs said on Thursday at the 15th Annual Meeting of the New Champions, also known as the Summer Davos.
The world's second-largest economy is a key source of global demand, playing a significant role in driving the world's economic growth and offering growing opportunities for global stakeholders, they said at the event held in Dalian, Liaoning province.
Despite pressures and mounting uncertainties at home and abroad, they said they believe that China has the capabilities and conditions to deal with structural issues and foster new quality productive forces in the long run.
Peng Sen, president of the China Society of Economic Reform, said he is fully confident that China will achieve its annual growth target of around 5 percent this year, given the support of the adopted macroeconomic policies and the country's accelerated push for fostering new quality productive forces.
""China's economy is on the upswing,"" Peng said on Thursday at a subforum whose theme was the country's economic outlook. However, ""the recovery process doesn't yet have very firm foundations amid insufficient demand, still-weak expectations among the public, and uncertainties, particularly from the external environment"", he added.
Advancing reforms will be key to tackling the issues facing the economy, Peng said.
More efforts should be made to provide policies supporting the innovative development of the private sector, accelerate the push for building a unified national market, deepen market-oriented reforms of production factors such as land, capital, labor, technology, and data, and address institutional improvements in the market economy system, he added.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Thursday that industrial enterprises with annual revenue of at least 20 million yuan ($2.75 million) saw their total profits increase 3.4 percent year-on-year in the first five months of 2024, compared with 4.3 percent in the first four months.
In May, China's industrial profits rose 0.7 percent year-on-year, compared with 4 percent year-on-year growth in April.
In an exclusive interview with China Daily, Joe Ngai, chairman of management consultancy McKinsey China, said the broader economy is still facing pressures from sluggish demand, pointing to market concern over a mismatch in supply and demand.
He said on the sidelines of the Summer Davos that more efforts are needed to improve the offering of consumer goods and services, create more jobs, and increase people's incomes.
Meanwhile, Ngai said China's 2024 annual growth target of around 5 percent is achievable amid a steady recovery in confidence, and the country is poised to contribute around one-third of global economic growth.
Zhang Xiaoyan, associate dean of Tsinghua University's PBC School of Finance, said the Chinese economy is gradually shaking off the impact of COVID-19.
Technological innovation, notably artificial intelligence and green industries will serve as new growth drivers boosting China's growth, Zhang added.
NBS data showed that the equipment manufacturing sector registered rapid profit growth with advanced, intelligent, and green development. In the first five months of the year, profits recorded by equipment manufacturing enterprises surged 11.5 percent year-on-year, which was 8.1 percentage points higher than the figure for overall industrial profits.
Svein Tyldum, CEO for North Asia at consultancy Marsh McLennan, said, ""The Chinese economy got off to a pretty good start in the first quarter and has some positive factors that have been laying a foundation for achieving its annual growth target.
""China's pursuit of high-quality drivers of production and China's economic development has created greater cooperation space for companies around the world to work together in a more harmonious way,"" he added.
Tyldum noted that China is Marsh McLennan's second-largest operation in Asia, and the company is committed to the China market, with more investment plans.
US-based smart building solutions provider Johnson Controls expressed strong optimism about the Chinese economy and opportunities in China, saying the company has benefited from the country's steady economic growth over the past few decades.
Anu Rathninde, president of Johnson Controls Asia-Pacific, said: ""We appreciate the continuous opening-up in China, and we appreciate the continuous reforms and the support and welcome for foreign enterprises. As China's economy grows, the foreign enterprises grow and benefit equally.""

The ministry is reviewing the materials submitted by the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCME), He Yadong, spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce, told a press conference.
""We are highly concerned that some practices of the EU's Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) have had a serious negative impact on Chinese enterprises' exports to and investment in Europe, to which we have repeatedly expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition,"" He said.
Since February, the EU has launched investigations against Chinese enterprises in accordance with the FSR, involving machinery and electronic products such as railway locomotives, photovoltaic, wind power and security inspection equipment, according to the CCCME.
The investigations have not only hindered the entry of Chinese products or services into the EU market and Chinese enterprises' investment in Europe, but also undermined the competitiveness of Chinese enterprises in Europe and affected the overall economic and trade cooperation between the two sides, according to the CCCME.
The chamber is taking active measures to protect the interests of Chinese industries and enterprises through legal channels, it said.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Economy,20240628,933,,,EU pork suppliers call for dialogue with China,"BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Officials and industry insiders in the European Union (EU) called for dialogue with China, after China's Ministry of Commerce launched an anti-dumping investigation into pork imports from the bloc.
The year-long probe was initiated on June 17 at the request of the China Animal Agriculture Association.
EU is China's largest source of pork imports, exporting 3.3 billion U.S. dollars worth of pork and related products to China last year.
EU officials and pork producers have voiced their worries about China's possible anti-dumping duties on the bloc's pork exports, saying such measures could deal ""a heavy blow"" to the sector.
Ksenija Simovic, senior policy adviser for trade at Copa-Cogeca, Europe's largest farmer lobby, said ""The European Commission should ensure that our sector does not bear the burden for disputes involving other sectors.""
CHINESE PRODUCERS HURT
In its petition submitted to the Ministry of Commerce, the Chinese association said the prices of EU pork exports showed a significant downward trend from 2020 to 2023, falling 8 percent during the period.
The continuous price decline has forced domestic pork producers to slash their prices by 20-50 percent, which has undermined the interests of the domestic industry, it said.
Pork is the main source of animal protein for Chinese people, accounting for nearly 60 percent of residents' meat consumption.
As the world's largest producer and consumer of pork, China has been expanding imports from the EU, which accounted for 54 percent of the country's total pork imports from 2020 to 2023.
According to the EU's 2023-2027 mid-term budget, the bloc pays 194 billion euros in agricultural subsidies directly to its member states, averaging 38.8 billion euros per year. Of the total, 82 percent could possibly go to high-emission livestock industries, including pig raising and related sectors, said the petition.
""The large amount of subsidies provided by the EU and its related member states has seriously distorted the market environment of fair competition,"" said a source from the association.
EU SUPPLIERS' WORRIES
Spanish Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Luis Planas told reporters in Madrid that he hopes and expects that ""there will be room for understanding, for negotiation, and to avoid the imposition of tariffs on agricultural and food products.""
Spain is the biggest EU pork supplier to China, followed by the Netherlands, Denmark and France. Spain exported 560,488 tonnes of pork products worth 1.2 billion euros to China in 2023, representing 20.3 percent of its total pork exports by volume and 13.7 percent by value, according to Interporc, Spain's pork producers' association.
The anti-dumping measures could impact Europe badly because a large portion of the bloc's pork exports to China are pig ears, noses, feet and offal that are rarely consumed by Europeans.
""It is not easy for the bloc to find an alternative market in a short time,"" said Zhao Yongsheng, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics.
As many pork producers in the EU rely heavily on export markets, losing the vast Chinese market would result in ""significant losses for EU pork traders,"" said Bai Ming, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce.
CALLS FOR DIALOGUE
The European Commission has proposed to levy provisional additional tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on China-made EVs starting from early July, after initiating an anti-subsidy investigation last year.
""The commission initiated the investigation on its own. But such an ex officio initiation without having received a complaint is more likely to be politically inclined,"" said Sun Lei, a lawyer and senior partner with Dentons, a law firm.
Industry specialists said that the strong export of China's NEVs is well underpinned by its industrial chain, which has built up its strength under full market competition, not state subsidies.
If the EU could impose additional tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars citing the excuse of unsubstantiated subsidies, it would be justifiable for China to levy taxes on the EU's heavily-subsidized agricultural sector, they said.
Amid strong opposition from China and some EU member economies, the bloc has agreed to start talks with China on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.
During a meeting with German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck on Saturday, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said China is willing to consider the reasonable concerns of both parties to avoid the escalation of trade frictions in a rational and professional manner.
Mauro Portela Lorenzo, trade officer from the Economic and Commercial Office of Spain in Shanghai, told Xinhua that all Spanish manufacturers involved are keen to collaborate and proactively provide all necessary information in seek of a favorable investigation outcome.
He said he hopes ""there will be a positive solution to this investigation.""
Zhao believed that the door for trade negotiations between the two parties is open. ""China, which has the initiative in terms of market access, technology, industrial chains, and logistics, is willing to accommodate the interests of both sides during negotiations,"" he said.
Bassas Romeu Gerard, chairman of Salomei, a Spanish manufacturer of sausages, said he hoped China and the EU can lower tariffs to boost bilateral trade.
The company set up a subsidiary in the city of Xuanwei, southwest China's Yunnan Province, in late 2023, and uses pork from both China and abroad as raw material.
""Dialogue and consultations are definitely the right way to solve disputes and avoid a vicious spiral of trade friction escalations,"" he said.

Gasoline and diesel prices will increase by 210 yuan (about 29.47 U.S. dollars) and 200 yuan per tonne, respectively, the National Development and Reform Commission announced in a statement.
Under China's current pricing mechanism, the prices of refined oil products are adjusted following changes in international crude oil prices.
China's three biggest oil companies -- the China National Petroleum Corporation, the China Petrochemical Corporation, and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation -- and oil refineries have been directed to maintain oil production and facilitate transportation to ensure stable supplies, the commission said.

""It is hoped that the EU and China will meet each other halfway to push for positive progress in the consultations as soon as possible and reach a solution acceptable to both sides, so as to avoid the adverse impact of escalating trade frictions on China-EU economic and trade relations,"" MOC spokesperson He Yadong said in a press conference on Thursday.
He said that China-EU cooperation featured complementarity and mutual benefits. ""The two sides have broad room for cooperation in green transformation.""
On June 22, Chinese Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao talked with European Commission Executive Vice President and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis via a video link. The two sides agreed to start consultations on the EU's anti-subsidy investigation of Chinese electric vehicles.
""At present, the working teams of the two sides have maintained close communication and stepped up consultations,"" He said.
The European Commission earlier this month disclosed a plan to impose additional duties on imports of Chinese EVs. The move, widely criticized as protectionist, unveiled provisional tariffs ranging from 17.4 percent to 38.1 percent for Chinese EV makers despite widespread market concerns and China's objections.

BUDAPEST, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The first scheduled passenger flight between Chinese city Guangzhou and the Hungarian capital Budapest, operated by China Southern Airlines, landed at Ferenc Liszt International Airport on Thursday.
As a part of the Hungarian government's ""Eastern Opening"" policy and China's Belt and Road Initiative, the two countries continue to deepen their bilateral ties with Hungary now having more direct flights to China than any other country in Eastern Europe, according to Boglarka Illes, state secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
""We are very pleased that our bilateral relations, our economic and trade relations are also steadily developing,"" Illes said after the Boeing 787-9 aircraft landed carrying over 200 passengers.
Francois Berisot, CEO of Budapest Airport, said that the new China Southern Airlines flight would create new opportunities for both business and leisure travelers. ""Guangzhou has always played a prominent role in international commerce and is still one of China's most important economic hubs attracting businesspeople and investors from all over the world,"" Berisot said.
Described as a ""milestone"" in developing China-Hungary relations, the flight's launch is expected to boost bilateral cooperation in business, trade, and investment, according to China Southern Airlines' Executive Vice President Qu GuangJi and China's Ambassador to Hungary Gong Tao.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Economy,20240628,837,,,"Product, service upgrades to keep consumption engine roaring","DALIAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China's potential for consumption remains immense and should be further tapped as consumer demands evolve with improving living standards, according to observers at the 2024 Summer Davos.
With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, China boasts a vast consumer market and a captivatingly diverse consumption landscape, said Jason Ding, managing partner of Bain &Company's Greater China offices.
Hannah Qiu, senior vice president and China CEO of PayPal, echoed a similar sentiment. She noted that Chinese consumers have become increasingly discerning, seeking the best products at competitive prices for their daily necessities.
While certain consumer categories, such as essential supplies, have experienced slower growth, other sectors, including healthcare products and services, are witnessing a surge in demand, according to Ding.
China's per capita GDP has surpassed 12,000 U.S. dollars, a significant milestone that often heralds a pronounced acceleration in consumption upgrading, as demonstrated by international experience.
""One outstanding trend in China's consumption market is that the supply side has not fully met the consumers' upgraded demands, particularly in the service sector,"" said Zhu Min, vice chairman of China Center for International Economic Exchanges, citing fields such as elderly care and medical services.
Pierluigi Antonelli, CEO of global healthcare company Fresenius Kabi, said they have seen clear, strong demands for their products in China, one of the company's top two global markets.
Since last year, China's service sector has seen a robust consumer spending wave. In 2023, the retail sales of services climbed 20 percent year on year, outpacing that of commodities by 14.2 percentage points. From January to May this year, the retail sales of services continued to outperform commodity consumer spending by rising 7.9 percent year on year.
The transformation of the consumption landscape is evident in Dalian, the northeastern coastal city of China, which is hosting the Summer Davos.
A prime example is Fisherman's Wharf, a picturesque area reminiscent of San Francisco. To meet the demands of visitors, a diverse range of establishments, including coffee shops and bookstores, have been introduced. During the recent May Day holiday, this popular tourist destination achieved a record-breaking daily footfall of over 30,000 visits.
""Our observation is that the visitors are increasingly willing to pay for unique and sophisticated items and experiences. This trend necessitates a continuous effort to upgrade and innovate their business offerings,"" said Zhang Hongwei, general manager of the development and operations department at the scenic spot's developer Haichang (Group) Co., Ltd. The company's latest investment at the spot is a new stylish fair street put into operation in May.
With China's demographics undergoing significant changes, Zhu Min believes that the age group between 20 and 60 will emerge as the primary driver of consumption in the country's future society. However, the availability of suitable products and services for this demographic remains limited.
To address this issue, the Chinese government has been actively working to enhance the supply in the consumption market. A comprehensive policy package was recently unveiled, aiming to promote new consumption scenarios across various sectors, including tourism, elderly and child care, automobiles, and electronics.
The policy package calls for identifying and meeting the diverse needs of different groups, such as infants, children, pregnant women, and the elderly.
""With a super-large market and a strong supply chain, China's consumption engine, a core driver for tapping its domestic demands, will remain strong,"" Ding said.

The ministry made the remarks in response to media queries, stating that S&P Global Ratings' decision to maintain a stable outlook on China, in contrast to Moody's Ratings and Fitch Ratings' move to downgrade the country's sovereign credit rating outlook, also reflected the independence and professionalism of its rating team.
China's multiple advantages, including a large market scale, solid development foundation, and the government's continuous efforts to optimize macro-control policies and strengthen counter-cyclical and cross-cyclical adjustments, have consolidated the country's economic recovery, said the ministry.
The ministry said the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund recently raised their forecasts for China's economic growth, confirming the above views.
S&P Global Ratings sent a team earlier to China for re-evaluation, communicated in-depth with relevant Chinese government departments, think tanks, and market institutions, and conducted research that supported objectively rating China's sovereign credit status.
China hopes that international rating agencies will visit China more often to gain a deeper understanding of China and view China's economic development potential and sovereign credit rating level more comprehensively and from a developmental perspective, the ministry said.

* The 15th Annual Meeting of the New Champions, also known as the Summer Davos, concluded on Thursday in the coastal city of Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
* China's high-quality development amid its drive to foster new quality productive forces has been a boon for countries and multinational companies across the globe.
* In promoting emerging industries, China has achieved its own economic growth and also made significant contributions to global innovation and sustainable development.
DALIAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Five years on, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions brought worldwide business gurus, political leaders and academic elites back to northeast China's coastal city of Dalian, exploring new horizons for future growth.
Many dialogues at the event, also known as Summer Davos, led to a consensus that China's high-quality development amid its drive to foster new quality productive forces had been a boon for countries and multinational companies across the globe, helping them weather the predicament of the world economy.
In various domains, ranging from technological development represented by artificial intelligence (AI) to green innovation spearheaded by new energy technologies, industry insiders at the event recognized that China is among the flagbearers, eyeing more spillover effects from China's progress.
China's continuous recovery and long-term improvement, as well as the transformation, upgrading and profound changes in its economy, will surely provide new and broad space for the development of global enterprises, said Chinese Premier Li Qiang, when attending a symposium for foreign business representatives at the event.
NEXT FRONTIERS WITH AI
According to Chen Liming, chair of Greater China of the World Economic Forum, future growth points will revolve around technological innovation and green low-carbon exploration, creating new engines for growth amidst global transformations.
Rapid advancements in areas including AI and energy transition are set to provide unprecedented momentum for the high-quality and steady development of the global economy, Chen noted.
For many distinguished panelists at the event, China serves as a prominent trendsetter and a second-to-none magnet for related industries amid the trend of exploring new frontiers of AI and new energy sectors.
""China's AI industry remains at the forefront globally. As a strategic technology that will lead the future, AI is considered a crucial engine for creating new quality productive forces,"" said Cai Wei, chief strategy officer of KPMG China Advisory, noting that the rapid development of AI in China is empowering various industries, enhancing efficiency and providing new opportunities for businesses and individuals alike.
China is leading the way in AI spending and serves as a significant contributor to the world economy growth brought by AI-related sectors, said Jessica Zhang, senior vice president, APAC at Automatic Data Processing Inc., an American provider of human resources management software and services, regarding China as one of the major global players in AI sector.
Speaking to Xinhua, Zhang said that China's development opportunities, openness and massive data resources are surely benefiting both domestic and foreign companies. ""We also see these great opportunities in China, and will continue investing in China and building our own channels to AI and AI tools.""
For Kang Xi, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in the United States, AI technologies advanced in China will benefit other countries.
""The technology advancements in many countries including China are open-sourced, with a spillover effect benefiting other developers globally,"" Kang told Xinhua. ""China's computing power and its vast consumer data are going to refine the foundation of AI models and also help create customized smaller models that can be implemented in other countries.""

SHARING GREEN DEVELOPMENT
Besides AI, China has been vigorously developing the new energy sector to meet its dual carbon commitments and help fight the climate crisis.
China provides 50 percent of the world's wind power equipment and 80 percent of global photovoltaic equipment. It has driven down the cost of renewable energy and helped some other countries obtain clean, reliable, and affordable energy.
Espen Mehlum, head of Energy Transition Intelligence and Regional Acceleration, World Economic Forum, spoke highly of China's green transition and highlighted its reference significance.
""We need to make sure that the clean energy revolution touches all countries of the world. That's where China is playing a leading role,"" Mehlum said, adding that China's related industries are effectively reducing the cost of clean energy for consumers in many countries and providing them access to this green technological revolution.
Benoit Boulet, associate vice principal, Innovation and Partnerships, at McGill University in Canada, also hailed China's vigorous energy transition efforts.
""We have to move away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible to renewable energy,"" Boulet said. ""China is really pushing hard right now, and I think that's a signal to the world.""

CHINA OPPORTUNITIES
Business leaders from across the world reaffirmed their commitment to China's opportunities at the event, applauding the country's rapid progress in new energy and AI as well as its open and expansive market.
China's innovations in the new energy sector, such as photovoltaics and lithium-ion batteries, have captured the world's attention, and there is also ample room for growth in AI, according to Martin Franc, chief executive officer of Invesco Australia.
Franc said the new sectors offer opportunities for multinationals and international organizations, and the company looks forward to future innovation and cooperation opportunities in China.
Premier Li Qiang said at the opening plenary of the event that the rapid growth of new industries and new drivers has buttressed the sound and sustained development of the Chinese economy. China has the confidence and capability to achieve the growth target of around 5 percent for this year, Li said.
Gaven Chai, vice president of Honeywell Industrial Automation and general manager for China, emphasized that China's opening up brings growth opportunities and new growth points, which is the reason why the country has attracted a huge amount of foreign investment.
Chai added that China's vast market offers diverse application scenarios for testing innovative solutions. ""For Honeywell, the Chinese market serves as an ideal testing ground to validate our innovative solutions,"" he said.
In promoting emerging industries such as new energy vehicles and AI, China has achieved its own economic growth and also made significant contributions to global innovation and sustainable development, said Cai Wei, suggesting businesses should fully seize these opportunities and work together to achieve a win-win situation for economic growth and global development.

Running from June 25 to 27, the ongoing event, also known as Summer Davos, has drawn over 1,700 representatives of the political, business, academic and media communities in more than 100 countries and regions to explore new frontiers in revitalizing the sluggish global economy.
Amid discussions among the leading figures, several keywords have emerged, shedding light on the economic trends commanding the world's attention.
ECONOMIC GROWTH & COOPERATION
The global economy is facing challenges such as complex and volatile geopolitical landscapes and increased economic uncertainty.
According to the World Bank, global economic growth is projected to slow for the third consecutive year, declining from 2.6 percent in 2023 to 2.4 percent in 2024. The period from 2020 to 2024 is set to become the slowest five-year span for global economic growth in the past 30 years.
The question of how to stimulate global economic growth and make the economic pie bigger has become a topic of discussion among participants at the three-day grand gathering.
At this year's forum, Chinese Premier Li Qiang provided a feasible solution.
When meeting with Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Klaus Schwab at the event's opening plenary, Li called on all nations and regions to maintain an open mindset, enhance their mutually beneficial cooperation and jointly seek new frontiers of economic growth.
Echoing Li's remarks, Schwab highlighted the necessity of global cooperation and innovation.
""To drive future economic growth, we must embrace innovation and foster collaboration across sectors, regions, nations and cultures to create a more peaceful, inclusive, sustainable and resilient future,"" he noted when addressing the opening plenary.
NEXT FRONTIERS & AI
As a term included in the theme of this year's forum, ""next frontiers"" for development in the future have been observed as a major topic of several sub-forums.
Future growth points will revolve around new growth engines from technological innovation and green, low-carbon exploration amid a global transformation, said Chen Liming, chair of Greater China of the World Economic Forum.
Among the frontier sectors widely discussed by one panel after another lies the most powerful engine for economic growth: artificial intelligence (AI).
Recent breakthroughs in AI, such as deep learning, generative AI and foundational models, have catalyzed remarkable progress in enhancing human innovation and driving economic development.
""The world is on the cusp of a scientific discovery revolution driven by AI,"" proclaimed the Top 10 Emerging Technologies report released at this year's Summer Davos.
CHINA
This year marks the 15th occasion that the Summer Davos has been held in China. When the inaugural event convened in Dalian in 2007, China's GDP was approximately 3.5 trillion U.S. dollars, accounting for about 6 percent of the global economy.
By 2023, China's economic output had surged to nearly 18 trillion U.S. dollars, representing over 17 percent of the global share and establishing China as a primary trading partner for more than 140 countries and regions. This substantial economic scale and steady growth trajectory have consistently placed ""China"" among the top buzzwords at both winter and summer Davos in recent years.
In an increasingly contentious geopolitical environment, China, as the largest emerging economy, plays a vital role in promoting international cooperation and multilateralism, said Elizabeth Ingleson, assistant professor of international history at the London School of Economics.
Meanwhile, in various domains, ranging from technological development represented by AI to business-model innovation spearheaded by internet platforms, industry insiders participating at the event recognized that China is among the flagbearers, eyeing more spillover effects from China's development of new quality productive forces.
""We're bullish about China going forward,"" said Shin Hak-Cheol, CEO of LG Chem. The chemical giant from the Republic of Korea has built over 10 production bases in China since it entered the market over three decades ago. ""We're not downsizing here, and we're really investing for the future.""

Profits of China's industrial firms above the designated size increased 3.4 percent between January and May from a year earlier, reflecting that industrial profits have continued to recover with the support of a range of targeted pro-growth policies, official data showed on Thursday.
Industrial firms with yearly business revenue of at least 20 million yuan ($2.75 million) saw their combined profits reach 2.75 trillion yuan between January and May, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
NBS statistician Yu Weining said that China continues to improve macroeconomic policies to boost the economy, adding that both market demand and industrial production have further improved, resulting in a sustained recovery in enterprises' profits.
Due to short-term effects such as the slow growth rate of investment yields, the figure for the January-May period contracted 0.9 percentage points compared with the first four months. However, major industrial enterprises' total profits grew 0.8 percentage points faster than that recorded in the first four months, underscoring the sustained recovery of industrial companies, according to Yu.
Among the 41 industrial categories monitored by the bureau, 32 recorded growth in profits.
Driven by the relatively rapid development of sectors including smartphones, high-tech vessels, and automobiles, the country's electronics industry reported robust profit gains, which surged 56.8 percent year-on-year during the January-May period.
The profits of the equipment manufacturing sector, the largest contributor to the overall major industrial profit growth, expanded by 11.5 percent from one year earlier, the data showed.
Yang Chang, chief analyst at Zhongtai Securities Research Institute, told the Global Times on Thursday that major industrial enterprises profits continued to rise in May, but their inventories continue to grow, indicating weak domestic demand.
He said private enterprises and State-owned enterprises posted stable performance in May while foreign-funded enterprises reported a drop in profits.
Yu said that the industrial profits had maintained an upward trend, but that the recovery remained uneven, and more efforts should be taken to promote the development of new quality productive forces, accelerate the building of a modernized industrial system, and expand domestic demand to consolidate the foundation of economic recovery.

Photo shows the Kunming International Flora Auction Trading Center in the Dounan Flower Market in Chenggong district, Kunming, southwest China's Yunnan Province. (People's Daily Online/Ren Yilin)
At the Kunming International Flora Auction Trading Center (KIFA) in the Dounan Flower Market in Chenggong district, Kunming, southwest China's Yunnan Province, hundreds of brokers quickly decide whether they should bid for flowers based on information such as varieties and grades. On average, a deal is made every four seconds.
Seven out of every 10 stems of fresh-cut flowers in the Chinese market come from the Dounan market.
Behind the thriving flower industry in Yunnan is a modern industrial chain that integrates production, sales and services.
Technologies have been leveraged to solve the challenges in seed breeding and flower cultivation. To further enhance independent research and innovation capabilities, Chenggong district has collaborated with the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences on several research projects, aiming to independently cultivate new flower varieties and accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements.

To guarantee freshness, many logistics service providers directly deliver flowers from planting bases, and adopt a multi-dimensional transportation model consisting of air freight, high-speed trains and cold-chain logistics. The application of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies ensures quick delivery of flowers. The Kunming Customs has also opened a green channel that enables round-the-clock customs clearance of fresh-cut flowers.
Meanwhile, digital platforms ensure intelligent management. A digital trading screen in the KIFA displays all kinds of information about flowers. A big data center contributes to formulating policies in the flower industry, grasping market trends, and guiding production. It also enhances the Dounan market's status as the wind vane and barometer of China's flower market.
Carrying people's aspirations for a better life, flowers provide an emotional value for customers, facilitating the development of flower tours and boosting the sales of flowers and relevant products like flower cakes.

Starting on Thursday, the minimum down payment ratio for first-time home buyers will be lowered to 20 percent, down from the current ratio of 30 percent, according to a notice issued by several Beijing municipal government departments.
For second-home buyers, the down payment ratio for homes within the fifth ring road will be lowered to 35 percent, and for homes outside of the fifth ring road, the ratio will be lowered to 30 percent.
Also notably, for families with two or more children, their purchase of a second home will be eligible for more favorable policies for first-time home buyers, according to the notice.
Beijing’s move on Wednesday followed similar measures by a growing list of cities across China to relax restrictions on home purchases in a bid to boost the real estate market.

The popular TV series To the Wonder has boosted Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's tourism industry. Besides the natural scenery during the daytime, Xinjiang's night economy flourishes after dark, showcasing the region's safety and prosperity.
In the Aletun Ancient Street in Hami, Xinjiang, many tourists can be seen strolling and dining even at 1 am. In the Liuxing Food Street in Yining, Xinjiang, people celebrate the Eid al-Adha (Corban Festival) by singing and dancing until 11 pm, Global Times reporters observed.
""I felt like this is a place where people are genuinely happy. It is very safe. We walk along really dark streets on our way back and have no worries. We are in the city center, surrounded by people celebrating their traditional festival. The atmosphere is great,"" Torbjorn Sassersson, the chief editor of the News Voice in Sweden, told the Global Times on June 18.
""My trip to Liuxing Food Street was very impressive. The large presence of people on both sides of the street demonstrated the strength of local consumption and good income levels. The food here tastes sweeter compared to other parts of China, and it makes me feel like I'm at home. I also feel very safe when I walk in the street with my colleagues at midnight,"" Ahmed Soliman, a foreign affairs chief editor from Egypt, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
""In the street, many ethnic minorities and tourists dance together, and we can join them at any time if we want,"" a tourist from Central China's Henan Province told the Global Times on Wednesday. ""I enjoy the vibrant and bustling nightlife,"" he added.
""The thriving night economy in Xinjiang is partly due to its long daylight hours and also benefits from the region's well-constructed infrastructure and stable social order,"" Wang Jinwei, a professor at the School of Tourism Sciences at Beijing International Studies University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
Hami's Aletun Ancient Street was selected as a model street for the night economy in 2023 in Xinjiang. This short 610-meter street boasts over 100 specialty shops, offering photography services, jade, ethnic embroidery, pastries, and barbecued food. It has become a must-visit spot for tourists in Xinjiang. ""Most shops in the street open around 6 pm and stay open until about midnight, depending on the volume of visitors,"" a shopkeeper told the Global Times on Saturday.
""Our studio has gained popularity in the past two years. After 6 pm, we see a surge in customers, and even after 10 pm, when it's already dark, there are still plenty of tourists coming in for photos,"" a member of staff at a photography studio in the Aletun Ancient Street told the Global Times on Saturday.
The development of Xinjiang's night economy aligns with the lifestyle habits of ethnic minorities and offers tourists a way to escape the heat while gaining unique travel experiences, according to Wang. ""This excellent integration of resources is expected to continue thriving, with personal safety being a fundamental aspect,"" Wang said.
Xinjiang has actively developed its night economy, including carrying out a series of night activities around dining, accommodation, transportation, and shopping. In recent years, nighttime tourism has become popular, showcasing Xinjiang's safety and vibrant economic momentum, Wang added.
From January to May 2024, Xinjiang received a total of 83.39 million passenger trips from home and abroad, a year-on-year increase of 13.69 percent. The region's tourism revenue reached 90.20 billion yuan ($12.63 billion), up 38.87 percent year-on-year, according to the local culture and tourism department.

Solar panels stretching across the vast Gobi Desert form a spectacular ""blue sea"" in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. (People's Daily Online/Li Xinyang)
Nestled in the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, over 800 meters above sea level in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, an awe-inspiring sight unfolds: a vast expanse of 1.2 million solar panels stretches across the Gobi Desert, forming a spectacular ""blue sea"" that harnesses the region's abundant sunlight.
This is the photovoltaic (PV) power station operated by PowerChina Renewable Energy Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Power Construction Corporation of China (PowerChina), in Fukang city, Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang.
Solar energy is converted into green electricity at the project and transmitted to factories, companies and households in Xinjiang and beyond.
Adjacent to the solar array, a ""super power bank"" consisting of 216 battery units can store 600,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity. The energy storage system helps balance the power grid by ""charging"" during low-demand periods and ""discharging"" during peak hours.
The PV power generation project feeds more than 1.2 billion kWh of electricity into the power grid on an annual basis, which can theoretically satisfy the power consumption demands of Fukang's entire population of 180,000 for seven years, according to Peng Wenchun, general manager of the Xinjiang branch of PowerChina Renewable Energy Co., Ltd.
With an annual industrial output value of about 280 million yuan ($38.57 million), the PV power generation project of PowerChina Renewable Energy Co., Ltd. can help save 366,600 tonnes of standard coal annually.

The annual amount of carbon dioxide emissions reduced by the project is equivalent to planting 4,800 trees – a significant contribution to China's carbon peaking and neutrality goals.
The power station employs 26 young staff members, who are responsible for such tasks as safety inspections and maintenance. These young professionals, with an average age of 27 years old, may spend two decades of their lives at the remote desert area, as solar cables last about 20 years.
Despite the isolation, they've created a vibrant community. After work, they play board games, enjoy cycling, and play badminton. They've even adopted a stray dog that has since had eight puppies.

""I've been here for six months and will stay for 20 years. I'm proud to be a part of the team safeguarding this power station,"" said Guo Dawei, deputy head of the PV power station in Fukang.
The project is an epitome of China's burgeoning renewable energy sector. In 2023, the country accounted for over half of the world's 510 million kilowatts of newly installed renewable energy capacity.
The rapid development of the country's green industries is attributed to technological innovations, institutional reforms, and people's hard work and dedication.

The local government taps into the city's resources for industrial development, and leverages industrial strength to drive the city's comprehensive development, continuously attracting investment in the new energy industry, explained Guo Linjuan, vice mayor of Fukang city.
Since the beginning of China's 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), Fukang has designated 3.6 million mu (240,000 hectares) of contiguous unused land and natural grassland for PV industry development, and offered streamlined administrative procedures for investors, with dedicated personnel to facilitate project approvals, according to a reliable source.

Developing VC is a key step to promoting the virtuous cycle of technology, industry and finance, said Li Chunlin, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, at a press conference.
With the typical characteristics of investing early, investing small and investing in hard technologies, VC is important in supporting the rapid growth of ""little giant"" firms and unicorn companies, said Li.
""Little giants"" refers to the novel elites of China's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are engaged in manufacturing, specialize in a niche market and boast cutting-edge technologies.
Official data shows that China has incubated 12,000 ""little giants"" and boasts a total of 369 unicorn companies, or startups valued at more than one billion U.S. dollars.
According to the measures, efforts will be made to encourage long-term funds such as insurance funds to flow into VC, support asset managers to expand investment in VC and enrich VC fund types.
A mechanism to connect VC with innovative and entrepreneurial projects will be established to provide VC institutions with a number of high-quality projects that are in line with the national development direction and strategic orientation.
The country will promote patent industrialization to support the growth of SMEs, continue to implement preferential tax policies for VC enterprises, implement differentiated regulation in line with the characteristics of VC funds, and expand the opening up of VC investment in an orderly way.
Efforts will be made to broaden the exit channels and optimize the exit policy of VC funds.
The country should prudently introduce contractionary and inhibitory measures, release more policy dividends, stabilize market expectations and activate the VC market, said Li.

Phil Foden posted a photo of himself with his new car on June 14, the opening day of the 2024 Euro in Germany. His new ride is the ""Seal,"" an all-electric vehicle made by Chinese automaker BYD.
Just like the English football star, UEFA, Europe's football governing body, has also chosen Chinese new energy vehicles.
In Germany, the heart of the European auto industry, BYD has replaced Volkswagen as the official auto partner of Euro 2024. This is the first time in the tournament's history that it has partnered with a new energy vehicle brand and a Chinese automaker.
UEFA Marketing Director Guy-Laurent Epstein remarked that this decision aligns with UEFA's vision of creating a greener Euro. ""BYD is globally renowned for its innovation in the new energy vehicle sector. We are optimistic about BYD's role in promoting the green transformation of Euro,"" he said.
This is just one example of Chinese partners' involvement in Euro 2024, where five out of 13 top-tier official partners of the tournament are Chinese companies, all from high-tech industries, including new energy vehicles, smart appliances, mobile payments, smartphones, and e-commerce.
Unlike past sponsorship where Chinese companies were only looking for brand exposure at sporting events, they are now deeply integrated into various aspects of the tournament. New technologies, new business models, and new ideas from China are reshaping the event itself.
SOLUTIONS FROM CHINA
If you watch Euro 2024, you must have noticed that whenever a VAR (Video Assistant Referee) review is conducted, the screen displays a Hisense logo.
Since 2016, the Chinese electrical appliance manufacturer Hisense has been an official partner of Euro for eight years. This year, Hisense also became the tournament's official partner for VAR displays.
This is the first time UEFA has opened commercial rights related to professional officiating. UEFA conducted multiple rounds of technical testing on Hisense products before making the final decision.
Passing UEFA's stringent technical tests highlights Hisense's technological prowess. Before the start of Euro 2024, Hisense launched its new all-scenario AI picture quality platform. For better football match presentation on TV, Hisense employs MEMC motion compensation technology to make high-speed motion scenes smoother.
Aside from providing technical products, Chinese companies are also transforming consumption methods. Alipay+, a global payment partner of the tournament, has introduced ""QR code payment"" to Europe.
Currently, users from over 30 electronic wallets and banking apps worldwide can make payments using mobile payment applications at all venues of the tournament. The blue QR codes from China are accelerating Europe's transition to the mobile payment era.
FOR GLOBAL REACH
For Chinese companies with global strategies, sports marketing is a vital accelerator for enhancing brand influence and international development.
Through the influence of Euro 2024, Alipay+ is expanding its business map in Europe. In April, Alipay+ partnered with European mobile payment platform Bluecode, enabling Alipay+ merchants to support mobile payment methods from over 300 banks in Germany and Austria. Currently, more than 400,000 merchants in Europe accept QR code payments.
In addition, BYD's five models have entered 19 countries and regions in Europe, with over 230 stores established.
Hisense's overseas revenue has grown from 23.4 billion yuan (3.30 billion US dollars) to 85.8 billion yuan (11.83 billion dollars), increasing its overall revenue proportion from 23% to 43% since 2016.
In Germany, where the tournament is being held, as of May this year, Hisense's sales of televisions priced above 500 US dollars have increased by 101% year-on-year. Hisense Germany's cumulative sales have increased by 52% year-on-year.
""The ability to command high premiums comes from product innovation. During the process of going global, we increasingly feel that Chinese companies that proactively transition to high-end markets are more resilient and competitive,"" said Fang Xueyu, President of Hisense International Marketing Company.
BENEFIT FOR ALL
As Chinese companies grow in the European market, they also bring new business opportunities and employment to Europe.
The ""scan-to-pay"" trend driven by Euro 2024 has caught the attention of European technology expert Efi Pylarinou. She remarked on social media that Alipay+ makes cross-border payments ""seamless,"" benefiting all kinds of merchants, from small ice cream stands to chain restaurants, and that the value of cross-border mobile payments will become increasingly prominent, fostering the growth of the tourism economy. ""This is the next digital era of cross-border payments,"" she said.
In December 2023, BYD announced the establishment of a new energy vehicle production base in Hungary to help build a green ""ecosystem"" locally and promote Europe's green energy transition.
Hisense, with nearly 10,000 employees in Europe, has five major production bases in Slovenia, Serbia, the Czech Republic, France, and Poland, and has established six R&D centers in Europe.
Fang pointed out that the brand recognition established through sports events like Euro has also changed the perception of Hisense's European partners. ""It shows that, unlike many companies that come to Europe for quick profits, we are here for the long term and are serious about building our brand.""
""In this way, we can build a partnership for mutual growth,"" she noted.

To achieve this, the country plans to conduct further research on ""the king of fruits"" and expand its plantations.
Recently, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesia's coordinator for cooperation with China and coordinating minister of maritime affairs and investment, visited China to deepen bilateral trade.
Luhut highlighted the potential export value of durian to China, which could amount to 8 billion U.S. dollars, on his official social media account on Tuesday.
Amid the growing demand for the exotic fruit in the Chinese market, the Indonesian government has made an arrangement involving the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) to conduct a study to ensure high-quality durians for export, as one of the steps to achieve the target.
Luhut also said that the Indonesian government was already building about 100 hectares of durian plantations situated in the provinces of North Sumatra and West Papua, and was planning to build more in other provinces, including in Central Sulawesi.
Those locations, he believed, can grow durian trees that can produce durians demanded by the Chinese market.
According to data from Statistics Indonesia, the archipelago last year produced up to 1.85 million tons of durians and more than 50 percent of total production came from the island of Java. East Java province is reported to be the largest durian producer in the country, with production amounting to more than 480,000 tons last year.
Meanwhile, the country's Ministry for Trade had reported that in 2022 Indonesia exported durians to China with the value amounting to 4.5 billion dollars and in 2023 the value increased to 6.7 billion dollars.
As China's appetite for durian continues to increase, the export value could likely increase again with an estimate of around 7 billion dollars, said the ministry's Director General of National Export Development, Didi Sumedi, in early April.
Over the past several years, the Indonesian government has been calling on farmers in the country to grow durian trees since the fruit has become a valuable commodity.
Five years ago, President Joko Widodo called on oil palm tree growers across the country to diversify their business and grow durian trees, as he believed that durian had better prospects in the international market than crude palm oil.
Indonesia is the world's largest producer of palm oil and the advice was given by the president amid low demand and the price decrease of crude palm oil in the global market. He said that China had high durian demand, however, most of its supply was not sourced from Indonesia.

Adugna Debela, director general of the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority (ECTA), said a few years ago, Ethiopia had been exporting 8,000 to 10,000 metric tons of coffee annually to China, which then ranked 33rd among importers of Ethiopian coffee.
""However, China has been importing up to 20,000 metric tons of Ethiopian coffee annually for the last two years, becoming the eighth-largest importer of Ethiopian coffee,"" Debela told Xinhua in an interview Tuesday.
In the past three years or so, the amount of coffee Ethiopia exports to China has been growing at an average rate of 27 percent annually, said Debela, who attributed the surge to a significant increase in Chinese coffee buyers who import coffee directly from Ethiopia.
He also credited the close collaboration between the Chinese Embassy in Addis Ababa and the ECTA in terms of searching for new markets, connecting Chinese coffee roasting companies, organizing exhibitions, and launching e-commerce and online sales.
Debela said the China International Import Expo and cross-border e-commerce platforms, which serve as effective gateways for overseas brands to enter China, have presented numerous opportunities for Ethiopian coffee beans to gain popularity in the Chinese market.
Talking about the performance of the coffee sector during the current Ethiopian fiscal year, Debela said Ethiopia has exported 252,000 metric tons of coffee to the world market, earning 1.28 billion U.S. dollars in the first 11 months of the 2023/2024 Ethiopian fiscal year that ends on July 7, 2024.
He said there would be a huge, growing demand for Ethiopian coffee in China as more and more people in China, especially youngsters, enjoy drinking Ethiopian coffee.
Debela said he hopes that China will become one of the top five Ethiopian coffee importers shortly as the ECTA continues exploiting untapped market opportunities there.
Ethiopia's coffee, originating from the region where Arabica coffee was first discovered, is praised for its distinctive flavors ranging from fruity and winy to chocolaty.

URUMQI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen from many parts of the world have converged in northwest China's Xinjiang, displaying exquisite goods such as French wine, Serbian coffee, Australian chocolate, and Ghanaian drums.
The 8th China-Eurasia Expo, held at the Xinjiang International Convention and Exhibition Center at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, commenced Wednesday in the regional capital of Urumqi.
Themed ""New Opportunities of Silk Road, New Vitality for Eurasian Cooperation,"" the expo will run until Sunday. It has drawn over 1,900 participants from 50 countries, regions and international organizations, showcasing over 6,000 varieties of products.
""This is our first time participating in the China-Eurasia Expo, and we hope to achieve fruitful results here in Xinjiang,"" said Nebojsa Terzic at the Serbian pavilion. He believes that the event will further cultivate Chinese consumers' appetite for high-quality Serbian products.
Covering an area of 140,000 square meters, this year's expo encompasses four major exhibition zones covering investment cooperation, international exhibition, special industries, and equipment manufacturing.
""We have brought multiple exhibits, including lightweight construction machinery, recyclable construction elevators, and a 5G tower crane simulation cockpit,"" said Zhang Heng, general manager of the Xinjiang branch of China Construction Third Engineering Bureau Group Co., Ltd.
Attributing their rapid overseas expansion to the deepening of the Belt and Road Initiative, Zhang expects more collaboration with overseas clients. ""We're already close to finalizing a project in Kazakhstan,"" Zhang added.
This year's expo has also set up a special pavilion for the China (Xinjiang) Pilot Free Trade Zone (FTZ), aiming to showcase its unique features, progress, and achievements of three areas in Urumqi, Kashgar and Horgos.
As the first pilot FTZ in China's northwest border areas, Xinjiang FTZ was officially established in November 2023. The FTZ has since embarked on an array of reform initiatives, marking a robust start to its development.
From January to April this year, the total import and export volume of the Xinjiang FTZ reached 38.5 billion yuan (about 5.4 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for 27.92 percent of the total import and export volume of Xinjiang.
Frances Wu, an exhibitor from Australia, spoke highly of Xinjiang's geographical advantage of being close to Central Asia. The company hopes to leverage this expo to gain in-depth understanding of policies of the Xinjiang FTZ, and intends to invest and establish factories in Xinjiang, with the aim of processing high-quality Kazakh camel milk powder.
""Being close to the source of raw materials, if we can establish production facilities in Xinjiang, the market prospects for our products will undoubtedly be very promising,"" he noted.
Li Xuan, an official at the regional department of commerce, stated that Xinjiang will fully leverage the platform function of the China-Eurasia Expo to develop public service products that facilitate exchanges and collaboration among countries in Asia and Europe.
Since 2011, the China-Eurasia Expo has successfully held seven sessions, yielding fruitful results. During past expos, more than 12,200 domestic and foreign exhibitors from more than 70 countries and regions exhibited, and it attracted a total of 2.16 million visitors.

""Dear clients, the imported cherries you ordered are expected to arrive at the international cargo department of Urumqi Diwopu International Airport at around 10 o'clock. Please pick them up as soon as possible!""

Every year from May to June, cherries from countries such as Tajikistan and Uzbekistan become a hit with Chinese consumers due to their tender flesh and juicy flavor. China is currently the largest consumer market for cherries from Central Asia.
The cherries imported from Tajikistan were transported through the belly cargo transportation service provided by China Southern Airlines, with staff members ensuring seamless operations such as unloading, sorting, and loading.
Customs officials supervised the unloading process on-site, and within half an hour, the cherries were transported to the designated customs area for imported fruit, where two customs officials efficiently completed the clearance inspection in 30 minutes.
Urumqi Diwopu International Airport has the advantage of short processing time and fast customs clearance.
The airport customs office has facilitated the creation of a dedicated pathway for imported fresh fruit and implemented a streamlined process for expedited clearance of perishable, high-priority, and special items. This has reduced the time required for customs procedures and allowed for immediate inspection and release, ensuring the prompt entry of cherries into the domestic market.

This photo taken on June 25, 2024, shows the opening plenary of the 2024 Summer Davos at the Dalian International Conference Center in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning province. (Photo/Xinhua)
China is accelerating steps to promote reforms related to the market-oriented allocation of data elements and put data assets into the balance sheets of enterprises, as data has become a new type of production factor and plays an increasingly vital role in bolstering industrial revolution, according to the country's top data governance regulator.
More efforts are needed to speed up the establishment of basic systems for data, facilitate the circulation, transaction, and utilization of data, and boost the construction of digital infrastructure, in order to fully unleash the value of massive data resources, said Liu Liehong, head of the National Data Administration.
Liu made the remarks on Wednesday during the World Economic Forum's 15th Annual Meeting of the New Champions, also known as the Summer Davos, in Dalian, Liaoning province.
Liu said that China is stepping up efforts to put data resources into better use as well as establish a data property rights system, a circulation and trading system, and a revenue distribution system.
The purpose of allowing companies to include data resources as ""intangible assets"" in their financial statements is to further encourage them to develop and make use of data, promote the circulation and trading of data resources, and empower social and economic development, Liu noted.
He also called for efforts to ensure data security and protect personal privacy and commercial secrets by leveraging cutting-edge digital technologies such as blockchain.
China's total data output reached 32.85 zettabytes in 2023, an increase of 22.4 percent year-on-year, while the added value of core digital economy industries accounted for 10 percent of GDP, according to the National Data Administration.
The top regulator has unveiled a guideline to expand the application scenarios of data elements in 12 key fields such as industrial manufacturing, modern agriculture, trade circulation, transportation, and financial services.
Lee Xiaodong, founder and CEO of Fuxi Institution, a domestic consultancy focusing on the internet and the digital economy, said at the forum that the utilization of data elements in the country is still in its initial stages and the immense value of data is yet to be fully tapped.
China has unveiled a set of accounting rules for corporate data resources. According to the Ministry of Finance, corporate data can be classified as ""intangible assets"" when it meets relevant requirements in accounting standards, while data held for sale in daily business activities can be recognized as inventory.
Ouyang Rihui, assistant dean of the China Center for Internet Economy Research at the Central University of Finance and Economics, said, ""With the rapid development of the data elements market, an increasing number of enterprises have attached great importance to the accumulation, development and application of data assets, and begun to incorporate data into their balance sheets to better reflect the real value and asset status of enterprises.""
Data elements have the attributes of commodities, which could be effectively allocated through market evaluation and trading, in order to create huge economic and social value, Ouyang said.
More efforts should be made to promote the confirmation of data-related rights as well as explore a data pricing mechanism and value assessment system, in order to give full play to the value of data and boost the development of the country's digital economy, he added.
Statistics from the National Industrial Information Security Development Research Center show that revenue derived from China's data elements market is projected to rise to 198.9 billion yuan ($27.4 billion) in 2025, with the compound annual growth rate surpassing 25 percent during the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period.

People.cn,"Tian Yi, Liang Jun",Economy,20240627,843,,,Nation vows to further deepen opening-up,"China will intensify efforts to further attract foreign investment, in order to drive the growth of the world's second-largest economy in the new development paradigm, according to an executive meeting of the State Council, the country's Cabinet, on Wednesday.
The meeting, which was chaired by Premier Li Qiang, decided that the country will take steps to deepen opening-up efforts in key sectors, focusing on removing market access restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector and introducing a new round of pilot measures to expand opening of the service sector.
Domestic and foreign companies will be treated on an equal footing when participating in various sectors, including in large-scale equipment upgrades and government procurement. Efforts will also be made to improve the facilitation of investment and optimize foreign investment policies in areas such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices, according to the meeting.
Additionally, it was noted at the meeting that China will release a revised version of the industry catalog that encourages foreign investment and makes it easier for foreign nationals to work in China.
Foreign direct investment in actual use on the Chinese mainland totaled 412.51 billion yuan ($56.8 billion) in the first five months of the year, which was 28.2 percent lower than the figure for the same period last year, data from the Ministry of Commerce showed. Despite the decline, 21,764 new foreign-invested enterprises were established, up 17.4 percent year-on-year, according to the ministry.
Meanwhile, foreign companies saw a 16.7 percent increase in profits in the first four months of the year, well above the national average of 4.3 percent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
The scale of foreign investment in actual use is still at a historically high level, even though there has been a decrease in the amount, which is primarily due to the impact of last year's high base, said an official with the Commerce Ministry.
Notably, in the first five months of the year, the manufacturing sector attracted 117.11 billion yuan, accounting for 28.4 percent of the total inflow of foreign direct investment. This represents an increase of 2.8 percentage points compared with the same period last year and points to ongoing improvement in China's investment structure.
Foreign businesses operating in China continue to exhibit stable investment expectations and confidence in the country's market. Recent surveys conducted by various business chambers found that more than three-fourths of United States, European and Japanese companies planned to sustain their operations in China, the official added.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Economy,20240627,838,,,Beijing unveils more measures to boost property market,"BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing on Wednesday announced a slew of measures, including lowered minimum downpayment ratios and mortgage interest rates, in its latest move to boost its property market. These new measures will be in effect from Thursday.
The minimum downpayment ratio for individual commercial mortgages for homes has been lowered from 30 percent to 20 percent for first-home purchases, according to a circular released by several bodies, including the Beijing Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and the Beijing municipal branch of the People's Bank of China.
For second-home purchases, the minimum downpayment has been lowered to 35 percent if the property is located within Beijing's fifth ring road, and 30 percent if located outside the road.
The lower limits for home loan interest rates have also been decreased, based on the tenor of the benchmark loan prime rate (LPR), according to the circular.
It said that to support the housing demand of families with more than one child, second homes purchased by families with a Beijing hukou (residence permit) and two or more children will be deemed first homes in terms of loan policy.
The Chinese capital is also encouraging real estate developers and agents to support home trade-ins, allowing residents to swap their current homes for new ones more easily, the circular said.
This is the second batch of measures that Beijing has announced in the last two months to optimize the city's housing policies.
On April 30, a notice permitted families with a Beijing hukou to buy one additional commercial house outside the fifth ring road, even if they already own two homes in Beijing. Single adults with a Beijing hukou, as well as single adults without a Beijing hukou but with a record of paying social insurance or income tax in the city for at least five consecutive years, were also permitted to purchase one additional property outside the fifth ring road, even if they already own one home in the city.
A number of other Chinese cities, including Shanghai, Hangzhou and Chengdu, have also adjusted their real estate policies recently, with measures including those to ease purchase restrictions and encourage trade-ins of commercial housing.

People.cn,"Tian Yi, Liang Jun",Economy,20240627,833,,,Euro 2024 sponsorship deals drive Chinese brands deeper into Europe,"Although China's national soccer team is not taking the field at Euro 2024, the country's flagship companies are filling stadiums and television screens through hefty sponsorship deals and advertising billboards.
Chinese companies account for more than one-third of the 13 top-tier sponsors at the ongoing UEFA European Championship in Germany, making the country the single-biggest source of sponsorship for the event.
The strong sponsorship demonstrates the rising technological prowess and competitiveness of Chinese brands on the global stage and their commitment to expanding into overseas markets, experts said.
Financial technology company Ant Group, home appliance giant Hisense, e-commerce platform AliExpress, smartphone manufacturer Vivo, and electric vehicle maker BYD are among the official global sponsors for the championship, which runs from June 14 to July 14, according to UEFA's website.
As the official payment sponsor of Euro 2024, Alipay+, the cross-border mobile payment platform owned by Ant Group, announced plans to expand cross-border digital payment acceptance and provide convenient payment services and special benefits for global soccer fans and travelers through its merchant network during the tournament.
Together with the company's two other international brands — Antom merchant payment services and international payments business WorldFirst — Alipay+ has appeared on LED billboards at tournament stadiums and on 50 TV channels across Europe.
The UEFA top scorer trophy, sponsored by Alipay+, will be awarded at the Euro 2024 final in Berlin.
Huge exposure
The company is accelerating steps to expand its presence in the United Kingdom and EU countries including France, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, and Germany as globalization is one of its core strategies.
As of this month, over 400,000 merchants in Europe accept mobile payments through Alipay+ from 14 international e-wallets and banking apps, according to a news release from the company.
Users of Alipay+ partner wallets can make mobile payments at department stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, airports, duty-free stores, restaurants, and tourist attractions by just scanning an Alipay+ QR code.
Alipay+ expects this summer to be busier than usual as sports fans travel from around the world to watch Euro 2024 and the upcoming Paris Olympic Games. The company said it will enable more merchants to benefit from the expected influx of fans, athletes, and tourists via its mobile payment technology and digital solutions.
In 2018, Ant Group's digital payment arm Alipay and UEFA announced an eight-year global partnership for all UEFA national team soccer competitions from 2018 to 2026, including Euro 2020, Euro 2024, and the UEFA Nations League finals. Before the partnership, major global sporting event sponsorship had for decades been provided by international bank cards like Mastercard and Visa.
This year's European Championship is expected to draw a global audience of more than 5 billion, according to the marketing director of UEFA.
Other global sponsors of the event include Adidas, Booking.com, Coca-Cola, and Qatar Airways.
UEFA estimates Euro 2024 will generate 2.4 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in revenue, mainly from broadcast and sponsorship deals, ticket sales, hospitality, and licensing fees for official tournament merchandise.
The tournament presents an important opportunity for companies to reach new consumers, increase brand exposure, and expand their businesses in overseas markets, industry insiders said.
In the 1980s and 1990s, it was common for Japanese and South Korean companies, such as Sharp and Samsung, to be major sponsors of international sports events, but in recent years they have been absent from top-tier sponsorship.
Chinese brands are now leading the change of sponsors, with their names seen in commercials and on billboards at global sports competitions.
It is the third consecutive UEFA European Championship for which Hisense has been a sponsor. The company is the official screen provider for the video assistant referees during this year's tournament, and it is providing display technology support for the central VAR room in Leipzig, Germany, to help on-field referees make decisions.
""Continued investment in world-class sporting events represents Hisense's determination to become a global brand, and it helps us build stronger relationships with global consumers and accelerates the company's globalization process,"" said Jia Shaoqian, chairman of Hisense.
In 2016, the company became the first Chinese sponsor of the UEFA soccer championship. It also sponsored the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
European advances
Shipments of Hisense TVs in Europe surged 35.9 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2024, data from market consultancy AVC Revo shows. The company accounted for 13.6 percent of global TV shipments during the same period, ranking second in the world, according to market research company Omdia.
Hisense, based in Qingdao, East China's Shandong province, has ramped up its efforts to expand its footprint in the European market in recent years. The company has set up six research and development centers and five major manufacturing bases, with sales revenue on the continent rising 19.5 percent year-on-year to 3.8 billion euros last year.
Hisense's total revenue surpassed 200 billion yuan last year, while its overseas sales reached 85.8 billion yuan, accounting for 43 percent of total revenue.
The company is also stepping up its investment in product research and development and technological innovation to target high-end overseas markets and improve its customers' viewing experience.
Fang Xueyu, president of Hisense's international marketing unit, said localization is at the core of globalization, and companies need to satisfy local consumers' demands as well as provide products suitable for local markets.
""Chinese companies sponsoring the Euro 2024 soccer tournament highlights these enterprises' determination in going global and leveraging major sports events to showcase their latest products, technologies, and achievements in innovation to a global audience,"" said Hong Yong, an associate research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation's e-commerce research institute.
Hong said sponsorship of important international sporting events is conducive to connecting with consumers across the globe, helping Chinese enterprises speed up global business plans, and significantly enhancing brand recognition and a company's international standing.
Sports marketing is an important way for Chinese brands to increase their global competitiveness, expand their footprint abroad, and boost sales in overseas markets, Hong added.
Electric avenues
For the first time, BYD is an official partner of the European Football Championship and has replaced German automaker Volkswagen as the event's official vehicle supplier. ""This prestigious event will enable us to showcase our latest advancements in electric vehicles to a far-reaching audience,"" BYD said on its website.
The company is providing a diverse range of new energy vehicles during the tournament. It is also presenting its latest new energy vehicle models and cutting-edge technologies at the competition venues, which help show soccer fans BYD's commitment to greener and more intelligent motoring solutions.
BYD exported over 242,000 vehicles last year, surging 334 percent year-on-year. It has entered the markets of more than 70 countries and regions, including 19 European nations.
In December, the company announced it plans to build a new EV production base in Hungary as it steps up efforts to make inroads into the European market. The facility, the first of its kind to be built by a Chinese auto company in Europe, is expected to create thousands of jobs. Hungary will be the center for BYD's European production operations, it added.
Ouyang Rihui, assistant dean of the Central University of Finance and Economics' China Center for Internet Economy Research, said, ""An increasing number of Chinese enterprises, especially those gaining a competitive edge in frontier sectors including digital payments, cross-border e-commerce, smartphones and NEVs, are seeking new development opportunities in overseas markets fueled by the rise of China's economic strength and industrial upgrade.""
Sponsoring Euro 2024 shows Chinese enterprises want to expand their sales channels and increase their voice on international cooperation, Ouyang said. The sponsorship will help more overseas consumers learn about China's technological advantages in some emerging and strategic forward-looking sectors, he added.
Vend it like Beckham
Cross-border e-commerce has become an important driving force for bolstering the steady growth of China's foreign trade.
Alibaba's cross-border online marketplace AliExpress is the exclusive e-commerce platform partner for Euro 2024 and is investing millions of euros in discounts, deals, and other promotions during the tournament.
""As football enthusiasm spreads across Europe, we will bring fans even closer to the action, with great deals on a vast selection of popular and trending products, as well as interactive games and the chance to win fantastic prizes,"" said Gary Topp, European commercial director of AliExpress.
The company has signed former English soccer star David Beckham as its global brand ambassador. Beckham helps fans participate in the ""Score More with AliExpress ""promotional campaign with exclusive discounts and prizes, including match tickets.
AliExpress and Cainiao Group, Alibaba's logistics arm, have expanded their global five-day delivery service to encompass several prominent markets. Consumers in Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK can now receive their parcels within five working days after placing an order on AliExpress.
Sales of soccer equipment soared 80 percent year-on-year in May, according to data from the group. Spain and France saw the highest sales of soccer balls, while the number of parcels sent to Europe from Cainiao's cross-border warehouses skyrocketed more than 300 percent in May from a year earlier.
Vivo, the official partner and smartphone provider for Euro 2020 and Euro 2024, said the sporting event provides an exceptional opportunity for the company to showcase its cutting-edge smartphone technology on the global stage and connect with soccer fans.
The company is committed to expanding its global presence and reaching consumers in more markets across the world.
Global smartphone shipments grew by 6 percent year-on-year to reach 296.9 million units in the first quarter, according to global consultancy Counterpoint Research. Vivo accounted for 7 percent of the market share and is among the top five smartphone makers.
Building brand image
Beyond financial sponsorship, Chinese companies have brought products and technological support for the tournament, said Jiang Han, a senior analyst at market consultancy Pangoal.
""Chinese enterprises can participate deeply in all aspects of Euro 2024 through the sponsorship, and establish a closer cooperation relationship with the event,"" he said.
This will not only help build brand image, reach more potential consumers, and boost the visibility of Chinese enterprises in Europe, but also create more business and cooperation possibilities to boost revenues and nurture new profit growth points, Jiang said.
""With the rapid development of China's economy and improvement of its international status, Chinese enterprises have begun to seek opportunities for international expansion,"" he said. ""Sponsoring world-leading sports events will enable enterprises to make forays into overseas markets and enhance their global operation capabilities.""
Zhan Junhao, founder of Fujian Huace Brand Positioning Consulting, said sports sponsorship allows Chinese companies to demonstrate their technological strengths and innovation capabilities. This is conducive to further consolidating and enhancing their positions in industries. It also enhances a brand's popularity and influence in the international market.
Enterprises should pay close attention to market dynamics and changes in consumer demand during the tournament, and adjust marketing and product strategies in a timely manner, Zhan added.

Participants of the 15th Summer Davos universally acknowledge China's leading role in the clean technology industry, saying that China's technological advancement and manufacturing capacity position the country at the forefront of the combat against climate change.
DALIAN, China, June 26 (Xinhua) -- As the 15th Summer Davos kicked off on Tuesday, green tech, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Chinese economy have become the most talked-about themes at the annual gathering.
Among the 162 sessions of the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, as the event is officially named, 38 are focused on the relationship between climate and energy, 26 are set with AI as the backdrop, and 22 look at the Chinese economy.
A scan of the event's 1,600-plus participants reveals that the overwhelming majority possess a background in these fields.
Participants say the themes reflect the most vibrant aspects of the world economy today.
""GOT TO PULL TOGETHER""
Participants of the forum universally acknowledge China's leading role in the clean technology industry, saying that China's technological advancement and manufacturing capacity position the country at the forefront of the combat against climate change.
""I see China as a potential leader since it's making huge investments in clean technology and innovation that can really power through sustainable development,"" Giorgia Ortolani, a member of the World Economic Forum's Global Shapers Community, told Xinhua, adding that China's potential to be the leader of sustainable development is huge and it could be a true game-changer globally.

Andrew Jones, co-director of U.S.-based climate research organization Climate Interactive, told Xinhua that China's photovoltaic solar power is ""happily displacing a lot of gas and coal use and is preventing climate change.""
Fergal Whyte, director of Arup Group, noted that China is scaling up solar farms, photovoltaic panels, and wind farms, producing meaningful percentages of energy for society.
The forum's participants also brushed off concerns about the so-called overcapacity of China's green products.
While there is some resistance to Chinese green tech in the United States, it is also purchasing many Chinese products at the same time, Jones said.
""I have some Chinese solar power on my roof myself,"" he said.
""I am confident we will overcome the resistance because we have a shared goal of addressing climate change. There will be more room for U.S.-China collaboration on addressing climate change, both in the international agreements, but also in the whole economic and solutions space,"" Jones said.
Whyte told Xinhua the concern in the West is not about the technology but rather a result of geopolitics.
""The technology is fantastic. I have no doubt that Chinese technology and electric vehicles will go to Europe, the United States and all over the world,"" he said.
""Unfortunately, we live in very complex times and there is geopolitics everywhere, but all of us have got to pull together and make sure that we keep our eye on the climate change and work together to combat that,"" Whyte added.
EMPOWERED BY AI
AI is another topic dominating podiums at the forum, with many participants pointing to China as one of the main innovators in the field.
""I'm very interested in AI and how it can be used broadly outside of technology, but in manufacturing, in energy, in making all the economies better,"" said James Nunn-Price, senior managing director of Accenture.
For his part, founder and CEO of Policy Nexus Thomas Liu told Xinhua that the application of AI to industrial scenarios is an area with huge potential.
AI would empower all the industry scenarios in different aspects, which would in turn contribute a lot to the world and AI applications. China plays a very important role in AI's industry scenario application, Liu said.
Tanvi Ratna, founder and CEO of the Indian research organization Policy 4.0, told Xinhua that as China becomes more active in AI governance, it would help make AI more equitable.
CHINA IS MORE OPEN
With the global economy facing challenges, the well-being of the Chinese economy is more consequential than ever.
Lourdes Casanova, a senior lecturer at Cornell University's business school, told Xinhua that China's economy has been traditionally based on exports, but is becoming more technology-oriented and has become a leader of green industries, with a strong performance in biotech and AI.
By maintaining low production costs, high exports, and investing heavily in technology for the long term, China can keep its economy in good shape, she said.
Ratna struck a confident note after hearing a speech by Chinese Premier Li Qiang at the forum, saying it signals that China is committed to market-driven growth.
""Whereas in many countries people are becoming very protectionist, China is opening more,"" she said.

Despite repeated dissuasion from China, the EU has included Chinese companies in its 14th package of sanctions against Russia, according to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce.
""These are unilateral sanctions and constitute long-arm jurisdiction. They have no basis in international law and are not authorized by the United Nations Security Council,"" the spokesperson said.
The move goes against the consensus reached by the leaders of China and the EU, negatively impacting China-EU economic and trade relations, the spokesperson noted.
China urges the EU to unconditionally cease the inclusion of Chinese enterprises on its sanctions list, the spokesperson said, adding that China will resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese firms.

People.cn,"Tian Yi, Liang Jun",Economy,20240626,836,,,Major buybacks put spring back in A shares' step,"A-share market investor confidence will be boosted and bourse performance will be buoyed amid record performance among listed companies' buyback plans, said experts.
According to market tracker Wind Info, over 1,900 A-share companies have announced their share buyback plans as of Monday. Among them, more than 1,600 companies have already carried out repurchases, with the total buyback value amounting to over 96.4 billion yuan ($13.3 billion), hitting a record and overtaking the full-year figure of 91.4 billion yuan seen in 2023.
A large number of industry giants have conducted share buybacks this year. Tongwei Group, the world's largest solar silicon provider, announced in late April a buyback plan of between 2 billion and 4 billion yuan. Video surveillance firm Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology released in April a repurchase plan of over 2.89 billion yuan while dairy giant Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group announced in late May it would repurchase no more than 2 billion yuan of its shares. Biotech company Wuxi AppTec and logistics giant SF Express have each announced 1-billion-yuan buyback plans twice so far this year.
Computer, medicine, electronics, and engineering equipment are the industries launching the most share buyback plans this year, according to Wind Info.
Zhang Qiyao, chief strategist at Industrial Securities, said that share buybacks will turn into an important positive signal for the market, as they reflect the companies' confidence in their profitability and income growth. Investors will thus derive positive sentiment on the companies' development.
Looking back on the previous rounds of drastic market fluctuations, A-share companies' collective share buybacks, which were promoted by supportive government policies, helped stabilize market performance and investor sentiment. The indexes usually picked up significantly after such repurchases, he said.
Related buyback policies have been optimized since the end of 2023, which have partly contributed to the record-high repurchases seen so far this year, Zhang said.
As the buyback scale expands in the A-share market, it can be seen that prices of companies announcing repurchase plans usually rise significantly, outperforming the benchmark indexes. Investors should keep a closer eye on these companies, especially as regulators have stressed the importance of share buybacks, he added.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's top bourse watchdog, released late last year its amended regulations for A-share companies' buybacks. Listed companies are encouraged to use repurchase tools according to relevant laws to provide returns to investors in an active manner, according to the new regulations.
The set of new guidelines released by the State Council — the nation's Cabinet — in April underlined the importance of listed companies' market value management. In specific, listed companies will be encouraged to cancel shares after repurchases.
Experts from TF Securities explained that the cancellation of shares after repurchase means that these shares will no longer circulate in the secondary market. Overall shares in circulation will therefore be reduced, and the company's financial indicators such as earnings per share, return on net assets per share, and dividends per share will likely increase as long as the current profit and dividend ratio remain unchanged. This will help increase the company's intrinsic value, they said.
Analysts from Great Wall Securities said that collective buybacks usually take place when the stock market is hovering around a nadir and market performance becomes lackluster. Repurchases will signal to investors that share prices are undervalued at the moment. Risk appetite will thus be elevated, they said.
The price-to-earnings ratio of the A-share market was around 16 times on Tuesday. The CSI 300 companies — 300 heavyweight companies trading in Shanghai and Shenzhen — saw their average PE stand at around 11.7 times, according to Wind Info. Both numbers were around very low levels compared with historical data.

CHANGSHA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- In the predawn mist off Kenya's coast, fishermen cast their nets into the sea, chasing wild anchovies. Little did they know, this catch would soon embark on a journey to China, where it would be made into tasty snacks destined for supermarkets across over 30 countries.
Jinzai Food Group Co., Ltd. in central China's Hunan Province drives this international operation. Since 2022, after Kenya's aquatic products gained access to the Chinese market, the company has emerged as one of the largest importers of these products.
""The company's sales of dried small deep-sea fish, have surpassed 1 billion yuan (around 140 million U.S. dollars) and tens of thousands of tonnes of fish are imported each year,"" said Zhou Jinsong, the company's chairman.
Zhou added that the company has set up a fish-processing factory in Kenya, supports the local government in conducting fishing surveys, and helps train fishermen into skilled industrial workers.
Jinzai exemplifies the thriving economic and trade exchanges between Hunan and Africa. The province has stayed at the forefront of China-Africa economic and trade relations. Featuring advanced agricultural technology, equipment manufacturing and infrastructure construction, Hunan has sustained an annual growth rate of 23.1 percent in economic and trade cooperation with Africa, according to official data.
In addition to Hunan, the five other central provinces of China, have been encouraged to establish inland reform and opening-up highlands. The region will accelerate the development of platforms such as the pilot zone for deepening economic and trade cooperation between China and Africa, as highlighted in a May press briefing by the Ministry of Commerce.
Guided by the national strategy, the provinces, located far away from borders and coastlines, are actively driving institutional and practical innovations in economic and trade cooperation with Africa.
The China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo, regularly held in Changsha, Hunan's capital city, has become a crucial showcase for African agricultural products, enhancing their international visibility.
In the city's China-Africa Economic and Trade Headquarters Building, hosts from both countries sell African products via live streaming to help them gain a footing in Chinese and global markets. Spanning over 100,000 square meters, the building commenced operations in mid-June and is expected to achieve a trade volume with Africa totaling 30 billion yuan over the next three years.
Numerous construction companies from neighboring Hubei Province have ventured into Africa, undertaking diverse engineering projects in sectors such as energy, transportation, municipal construction, housing, telecommunications, and metallurgy.
North of Zambia's capital Lusaka, about 88 kilometers along a major highway, lies rows of modern standard factories and a grid of straight roads. This area is Jiangxi Province's first overseas economic and trade zone, the Zambia-Jiangxi Economic Cooperation Zone, which was completed after five years of construction.
The area will be developed into a new eco-friendly urban area that combines industry, trade, logistics, comprehensive services, leisure, healthcare, education, and essential living facilities, said Xu Jianfeng, the zone's general manager.
""We see the booming trade as a win-win situation which keeps growing,"" said South African Ambassador to China Siyabonga Cyprian Cwele. ""And the massive growth in bilateral trade has been translated into direct benefits to our people.""

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Economy,20240626,814,,,State Council specifies priorities for further promoting private economy,"BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China will step up its efforts to boost the development of the private sector, according to a State Council report Tuesday.
Entrusted by the State Council, Zheng Bei, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, delivered a report on promoting the development of the private sector to the 10th Session of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress.
Since the 18th Communist Party of China National Congress in 2012, fruitful achievements have been made in promoting the development of the private economy, according to Zheng.
Data shows that from 2012 to 2023, the proportion of private enterprises in the country's total number of enterprises increased from 79.4 percent to 92.3 percent, while a total of 124 million individually owned businesses had been registered by the end of last year, up from about 40 million in 2012.
The report said that China's comprehensive national strength, deepened reforms, and sci-tech and industrial revolution have provided the foundation, impetus and opportunities for the growth of the private sector.
However, the private sector still faces challenges regarding market access, supply of services and business management, the report noted.
The report listed six priorities for further promoting the development of the private sector.
To optimize the environment for the development of the private economy, the report emphasized the need to promptly revise the detailed rules for fair competition review and expedite the establishment of a unified, standardized, coordinated and scientifically efficient credit repair system.
To increase credit support for private enterprises, the report said support should be provided for qualified private enterprises in their initial public offerings and refinancing, and more support for startups and seed-stage entrepreneurship.
The report also underscored the need to expedite the enactment of the law on promoting the development of the private economy.
The report called for efforts to enhance policy coordination, facilitate capacity building for private enterprises, and cultivate a favorable social environment conducive to the development of the private economy.
Zheng said the commission will introduce more practical measures and vigorously implement policies to promote the high-quality development of the private economy.

According to the MOC, China's e-commerce activities since the beginning of the year have played a positive role in promoting consumption recovery and expanding international economic and trade cooperation.
In the first five months, online retail sales totaled 5.77 trillion yuan (about 810.11 billion U.S. dollars), representing an increase of 12.4 percent from a year earlier, the MOC said, noting that promotional activities on the online e-commerce platforms such as ""618"" shopping festival powered the retail sales growth.
The country has also signed new memorandums of e-commerce cooperation with Serbia and Bahrain, expanding the number of Silk Road E-commerce partner countries to 32, according to the ministry.
In the first quarter of 2024, the proportion of cross-border e-commerce in total platforms of exports increased to 7.8 percent. Cross-border e-commerce activities contributed more than 1 percentage point to export growth in the first three months, the ministry said.

The China General Chamber of Commerce - USA (CGCC)'s 11th Annual Business Survey on Chinese Enterprises in the United States, released during the ongoing SelectUSA Investment Summit, showed that over 60 percent of the surveyed companies reported a deteriorating business and investment environment; 27 percent did not perceive any significant change; and only 13 percent noted a slight improvement compared to the previous year.
The profit margin distribution showed a significant decline, reminiscent of the early pandemic period in 2020. Notably, there was an increase in the number of companies experiencing a decline in profit margins over the years.
Regardless of the overall deteriorating environment and declining profit margins in some cases, a notable degree of long-term optimism persisted, with the majority of Chinese companies expressing positive future revenue expectations, the report said.
Nearly 90 percent of companies maintained or planned to increase their investment levels in the United States, reflecting a commendable sense of optimism, determination, and resilience, the report said.
""From a longer-term perspective, trade and investments have always been the cornerstone of the U.S.-China relations,"" said Hu Wei, Chairman of the CGCC, who is also president and CEO of Bank of China U.S.A.
Despite the various uncertainties, China remains the United States' third-largest trading partner and its largest importer, Hu noted.
Under the guidance of the ""San Francisco Vision"" outlined by the presidents of the two countries, companies from both sides need to strengthen communication and coordination to reduce unnecessary trade frictions and policy barriers and foster a more stable and open bilateral trade environment, Hu said.
""This will not only help promote the recovery of the two countries' economies but also lay a solid foundation for the sustainable development of the global economy,"" Hu said.

Chinese businesses operating in Poland highlighted the two countries' steadily growing trade in recent years. However, they said there is still significant potential to enhance trade cooperation, calling for strengthened mutual political trust and deepened cooperation across all sectors to foster enduring, high-quality opportunities for businesses and individuals from both nations.
This year marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Polish President Andrzej Duda is currently on a state visit to China. Economic and trade cooperation is part of the focus of the high-level visit, according to Polish media reports.
The Polish leader said on Sunday that the two countries are poised to sign several economic agreements during the visit, highlighting ongoing efforts to access the Chinese market for Polish poultry and beef, while also aiming to attract increased Chinese investment, the Polish Press Agency reported.
""Despite external uncertainties, I believe both sides will prioritize economic interests,"" Han Baohua, the president of the Chinese-Polish Chamber of Commerce, told the Global Times in a recent interview, saying access to the vast Chinese market is of great importance to the Polish government and enterprises.
""Poland excels in agricultural exports and has developed advanced food processing technologies. Local enterprises are keen to collaborate with China in these areas of strength,"" Han said, adding that cosmetics, machinery, manufacturing, and the new-energy sector also hold promise for trade expansion.
In the first five months of 2024, bilateral trade grew 5.2 percent year-on-year to 126.06 billion yuan ($17.37 billion). China has been Poland's second-largest trading partner for several years, and Poland is China's largest trading partner in Central and Eastern Europe, according to official data.
As an EU member state and a leader in Central and Eastern Europe, Poland serves as a pivotal gateway for Chinese enterprises seeking European access under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Sun Tianping, a research fellow at the Institute of European Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday.
China has always valued its economic relations with Poland, which stands as an important economic partner for China in Central and Eastern Europe, Sun said, adding that the high-level visit is expected to foster political trust between the two countries amid the volatile international landscape, thereby facilitating pragmatic cooperation in the economic sector.
""We hope that Poland can fully utilize its advantage as a key hub along the China-Europe Railway Express and a gateway to the EU, fostering cooperation with China in various sectors including electric vehicles, batteries, energy storage, smart energy management, e-commerce and high-quality agricultural products to enhance the potential for bilateral trade cooperation,"" said Shi Liren, chairman of the Chinese Business Association in Poland.

People.cn,"Tian Yi, Zhong Wenxing",Economy,20240625,1333,,,China’s national pension insurer introduces foreign investor as financial opening-up picks up speed,"Chinese national pension insurer Guomin Pension & Insurance Co said on Monday that German investment firm Allianz Global Investors GmbH will become a strategic investor. Analysts said that foreign financial institutions and patient capital continue to hike investment in China's pension finance market, indicating their confidence in the country's long-term economic growth and enormous business opportunities brought about by China's financial opening-up.
According to a statement on the website of Guomin Pension & Insurance Co, Allianz Global Investors plans to spend about 284 million yuan ($39.12 million) to buy a total of 228 million shares of the insurer. After the deal, Allianz Global Investors will have a 2 percent stake in the insurance firm.
The deal needs to be approved by the National Financial Regulatory Administration (NFRA), it said.
Guomin Pension &Insurance Co, jointly launched by China's largest banks and insurers in 2022, said its in-depth cooperation with Allianz Global Investors will bring an international perspective and professional experience, helping the company enrich product and service supplies in the third pillar of China's pension system and better meet the public's demand for pension security and wealth management.
""Allianz Global Investors is committed to growth in China, we are dedicated to exploring suitable business opportunities and partnerships in this important market,"" the company told the Global Times on Monday.
China's pension finance now has been in a strategic opportunity, since the Central Financial Work Conference held in Beijing in October made pension finance one of the focuses in the country's development into a financial powerhouse.
The German financial firm's investment in a newly established professional pension insurance firm in China sends a signal that foreign financial institutions and patient capital continue to increase their investment in China's pension finance sector, and they are showing their confidence in China's long-term growth potential, Liu Guohong, director of the Department of Finance and Modern Industries at China Development Institute in Shenzhen, told the Global Times on Monday.
Zhao Qingming, a Beijing-based veteran financial analyst, told the Global Times on Monday that China's financial opening-up has made remarkable achievements in recent years, with the number of foreign-funded firms posting a fast increase and foreign investment in China's financial markets reporting notable growth.
The sound cooperation and competition have also enhanced Chinese local financial institutions' capacity in serving the real economy and meeting consumers' diversified demand, Zhao said.
In 2024, foreign financial institutions have continued to expand their investment in China. HSBC recently said that it completed the acquisition of Citi's retail wealth management business in the Chinese mainland, while a couple of foreign financial institutions -- Fidelity Investment Group and Alliance Bernstein -- moved to increase the registered capital of their Chinese subsidiaries.
Over recent years, the country has rolled out more than 50 measures to expand financial opening-up, including scrapping foreign ownership caps in the banking and insurance sectors, and slashing access thresholds for foreign investors, according to NFRA.
As of January, 24 foreign Global Systemically Important Banks had established institutions in China and nearly half of the world's top 40 insurance companies had entered the Chinese market, data from the NFRA showed.
Opening-up is an important driving force for the reform and development of China's financial industry, and China sincerely welcomes more foreign institutions and long-term capital to come to China to do business, Li Yunze, head of the NFRA, said at the annual Lujiazui Forum held in Shanghai last week.
""We will steadily boost institutional opening-up, relax the scope of foreign shareholders in non-bank financial institutions in China, and encourage qualified foreign-funded institutions to participate in business pilot programs in order to support foreign-funded institutions to explore the China market and conduct stable operations,"" Li said.
With China's steady economic growth, the country remains a popular destination for foreign investment, especially in technology innovation, the energy transition, the pharmaceutical sector and consumer goods, Ginger Cheng, CEO of DBS China, told the Global Times in a recent interview.
China's GDP growth of 5.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter comfortably topped forecasts. Domestic demand has been strengthening, with consumer spending and investment both picking up. This provides an important driving force for continued economic expansion, Cheng said.
In March, the State Council, the country's cabinet, issued an action plan to steadily promote high-level opening-up and make greater efforts to attract and utilize foreign investment. It said that efforts will be made to expand the access of foreign financial institutions in the banking and insurance sectors, and expand the business scope of foreign financial institutions participating in the domestic bond market.
""China is expected to roll out more financial opening-up measures,"" Liu said, noting that the country should continue to boost institutional opening-up and align its financial rules and governance with international standards to attract more foreign financial institutions.
The authorities should enhance financial governance capability to match the opening-up level, Zhao said, noting that efforts are needed to step up supervision and evaluation of cross-border financial risks and safeguard national financial stability and safety.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Zhong Wenxing",Economy,20240625,1313,,,"Interview: China's PV efforts propel European decarbonization, says Intersolar Europe organizer","MUNICH, Germany, June 25 (Xinhua) -- With continuous innovations in the photovoltaic (PV) industry, China has offered Europe and the world high-quality products in recent years, significantly advancing their decarbonization efforts, said an organizer of the recently concluded Intersolar Europe exhibition.
""China has really helped the world in the last years to get those competitive PV products we need for the transition to a decarbonized society,"" said Markus Elsaesser, founder and CEO of the German Solar Promotion GmbH, in a recent interview.
""Therefore, I think it is good to foster such cooperation,"" he added, emphasizing the aspiration to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation between Chinese and European parties.
The three-day Intersolar Europe exhibition, the largest and most influential one in the European PV industry, attracted approximately 3,000 exhibitors from across the globe to showcase their latest products and solutions in such areas as PV modules and energy storage systems.
Elsaesser stressed that China, with 976 exhibitors, topped the list of participating countries for the first time since the exhibition's inception, followed by Germany with 934 exhibitors.
Innovative breakthroughs of Chinese PV manufacturers were in the spotlight at the exhibition each year, he noted.
For example, he said, manufacturers utilize fewer materials to reduce costs when developing solar panels with higher photoelectric conversion efficiency, resulting in less required installation space and a higher number of installed projects.
""These innovations are good for the decarbonization of our industry and society in Europe and globally, and that is very much driven by Chinese manufacturers as the global market share from them is very high,"" he stated.
In Elsaesser's view, all renewables including the PV industry are vital for Germany and the broader European landscape, given their clear objectives to decarbonize the continent.
""We are on a good track,"" but much remains to be done to achieve these goals, ""therefore we need solar energy, batteries, as well as electric vehicles on the roads,"" he said, adding that such competitive, reliable and sustainable products are precisely what Chinese manufacturers can provide.
Elsaesser noted that China's PV industry has successfully established a complete value chain from raw materials to final products on a large scale, underscoring its significance for Europe.
""I hope to see more cooperation in Europe with Chinese companies in the PV field, like we have already seen in the battery sector, where Chinese firms have built production facilities in European countries like Germany and Hungary,"" he said.
Elsaesser pointed out that the development of the global PV industry should not be hindered by any trade barriers, particularly given Europe's increasing demands for sustainable and localized production.
Cooperation between Chinese and European entities could enhance the resilience of the European market and support Chinese companies in deepening their business operations in Europe. ""So, the cooperation is a win-win situation,"" Elsaesser concluded.

Kjeld Riegen, head of China's NEV brand Voyah at Gomes Noord, shared his enthusiasm for the business prospects of working with Voyah, a high-end division of the Chinese Dongfeng Motor Corporation.
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua on the opening day of Voyah's first store in the Netherlands last week, Riegen emphasized the technology and reliability of the Chinese NEVs, noting their high cost-effectiveness and appeal to European consumers.
""The general picture of Voyah in the Netherlands is looking good,"" said Riegen, adding that Gomes Noord plans to open three more Voyah stores in the Netherlands.
""In September, we will start in Belgium as well. So it looks very promising. We have a nice model lineup, and the quality of Voyah is great,"" he said.
Gomes Noord, which also represents Germany's leading luxury automaker Mercedes-Benz in the Netherlands, has divided its new showroom into two sections showcasing both Voyah and Mercedes-Benz vehicles side by side.
During the store opening, several Dongfeng Motor NEV models made their Dutch debut, including the Voyah concept car i-Cozy, Mhero 1, Dongfeng Box, and Dongfeng 007.
Riegen highlighted that extensive testing had been carried out to ensure the quality of Voyah vehicles. ""We have the utmost trust in the quality of Dongfeng products,"" he said.
Having recently traveled to China, Riegen was impressed by the progress he witnessed firsthand. He attended a global event of Dongfeng Motor in April, and visited the Beijing auto show.
""It's very impressive. We saw autonomous cars driving in Wuhan and new models from various Chinese brands. The electrified traffic was quiet, giving a glimpse of what we can achieve in the future as we electrify our cars more in Holland,"" he said.
Riegen highlighted the rapid advancement of Chinese brands' technology, particularly in autonomous driving systems.
Confident in the growing popularity of Chinese NEVs in Europe, Riegen noted the high level of technology, as well as the reliability, battery capacity, luxurious feel, and affordability of these vehicles.
""We have a total range to offer our customers,"" he said. ""I think it's suitable for most countries.""
He is also a strong advocate for the future of NEVs and intelligent mobility.
""The Netherlands is leading in adapting to new mobility trends, and I believe we have a bright future ahead with smart mobility and autonomous driving,"" he said.
Riegen shared his own experience: ""I really love the Voyah Free. It drives tremendously, with great power and all options.""
""The Mhero is another impressive model, a dream car with immense power. The quality of the smaller Dongfeng Box is also remarkable. Overall, I am impressed by multiple models of the brand,"" he said.

The opening ceremony of the Kazakhstan Year of Tourism in China in 2024 was recently held in Beijing. China and Kazakhstan will hold a series of splendid activities throughout the year of tourism, which include art performances and tourism forums.
Kazakhstan boasts abundant tourism resources, such as the Shymbulak Ski Resort, Lake Kaindy, Charyn Canyon, the Korgalzhyn State Nature Reserve, and the National Park Burabay, attracting a large number of tourists every year.
The Kazakh government has set a goal to increase domestic tourist visits to 11 million and foreign tourist visits to 4 million by 2030. Besides, the number of people employed in the tourism industry is expected to reach 800,000 by that time.
Kazakh Minister of Tourism and Sports Yermek Marzhikpayev said that China is one of Kazakhstan's priority tourism markets and partners, owing to the two countries' geographical proximity and profound historical connections.
Kazakhstan plans to attract more Chinese tourists by leveraging its rich nomadic culture, centuries-old history, and unique natural landscapes, the minister added.
In recent years, China and Kazakhstan have witnessed continuously deepening tourism cooperation. In November 2017, China officially set up a tourism office in Astana, which was the first one of its kind established by China in a Central Asian country. The office has played an active role in promoting cultural and tourism exchanges between the two countries. In November 2023, mutual visa exemption between China and Kazakhstan was implemented, further stimulating the travel demand of tourists from both sides.
Since the beginning of this year, the number of Chinese tourists traveling to Kazakhstan has been on the rise, making the Central Asian country an emerging popular outbound travel destination.

According to statistics from Chinese online travel agency Ctrip, the number of tourism bookings to Kazakhstan by Chinese tourists this year has increased by 229 percent year on year, and 262 percent compared to 2019.
Data from another Chinese online travel platform Fliggy showed that since March, the number of flight bookings to Kazakhstan has increased more than threefold from a year ago. Almaty, Astana and Aktau are especially favored by Chinese tourists.
""Currently, Chinese tourists can take direct flights to Kazakhstan from Beijing, Xi'an, Hangzhou, and Urumqi, or enter the country through land ports in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. Natural scenery and local culture are major attractions,"" said Xu Jia, general manager of a travel agency in Sichuan province.
Xinjiang is adjacent to Kazakhstan. Therefore, some Chinese tourists would have a tour in the autonomous region first and then go to Kazakhstan via places like Horgos.
It is reported that the Horgos international highway bus station has four international passenger routes to Kazakhstan, and with the arrival of the peak tourist season, there has been a significant increase in the number of tourists traveling between China and Kazakhstan.
The China-Kazakhstan Horgos International Border Cooperation Center located in the Horgos Area of the China (Xinjiang) Pilot Free Trade Zone is always bustling with activities. The cooperation center spans the border between China and Kazakhstan, covering a total area of 5.6 square kilometers.
Citizens of China and Kazakhstan, as well as third countries, can enter or leave the cooperation center visa-free for up to 30 days, which facilitates face-to-face business negotiations, trades, tourism and shopping.
The passage connecting China and Kazakhstan in the cooperation center has become a popular photo spot for tourists.

It is reported after the cooperation center resumed full operation in 2023, the number of tourists has shown an exponential growth. It handled a total of 4.18 million inbound and outbound tourist visits throughout the year, a year-on-year increase of 4.27 times.
This year, the cooperation center has once again experienced a peak in cross-border tourism and shopping, with tens of thousands of tourists entering and leaving the cooperation center every day.
Marzhikpayev said that the Kazakhstan Year of Tourism in China is a milestone event that helps strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries.
""We believe that the dialogue between the two sides will inject new vitality into the partnership in the tourism sector, open up new prospects, and lay the foundation for fruitful long-term cooperation,"" the minister noted.
Kairat Batyrbayev, executive director of the Eurasian International Studies Association in Kazakhstan, said that China's outbound tourism is booming and it is expected that more Chinese tourists will choose to travel to Kazakhstan in 2024.
This will help drive the development of Kazakhstan's tourism industry and promote the upgrading of supporting infrastructure such as roads, hotels, and restaurants, Batyrbayev noted, adding that Chinese tourists gaining a deeper understanding of Kazakh culture, customs, and food will further deepen the cultural exchange between the two countries.

PRAGUE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Direct flights between the capital cities of China and the Czech Republic officially resumed on Monday, with the arrival of a Hainan Airlines aircraft at the Prague Airport in the early morning after a 10-hour flight.

China-made new energy vehicles await shipment to Europe in Xiamen, Fujian province. JIANG KEHONG/XINHUA
As trade frictions intensify and threaten a ""trade war"" between China and the European Union, experts and government officials said that initiating talks is an effective approach to prevent further escalation and resolve differences.
In response to media reports suggesting China's anti-dumping probe into imports of certain pork and pig by-products from the EU is a countermeasure against the European Commission's announcement of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, China's Ministry of Commerce emphasized last week that the current trade frictions with the EU are not what China desires.
Various industries in the EU have expressed concerns about escalating trade tensions potentially triggering a ""trade war"", said the ministry.
In recent years, with the profound and complex changes in the international landscape and regional situations, the EU and some member countries have deliberately viewed China as a ""geopolitical challenge"".China has been portrayed as a so-called economic competitor to Europe, said Cui Hongjian, a professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University's Academy of Regional and Global Governance.
""Currently, trade frictions between the two sides are still at an initial stage, leaving a window for properly resolving disputes,"" said Cui.
Similar views were expressed by Wan Zhe, a researcher at the Belt and Road School of Beijing Normal University.
""With some time remaining before the EU's final decision on imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs, both China and the EU need to bring their economic and trade relations back to the track of dialogue and cooperation.""
Although Chinese EVs account for just a small share of the EU's EV imports, the European Commission in mid-June unveiled additional provisional tariffs ranging from 17.4 percent to 38.1 percent for Chinese EV manufacturers despite widespread market concerns and China's objections.
""The EU should overcome its protectionist mindset, staying true to the principles of free trade that it has always claimed to uphold,"" said Wan, noting there are no fundamental conflicts of interest between China and the EU, and their common interests far outweigh their differences.
The key question that both sides need to jointly address now is how to better adhere to the principles of cooperation and ensure their common interests amid these changes, she added.
During his meeting with Robert Habeck, German vice-chancellor and federal minister for economic affairs and climate action over the weekend, Chinese Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao said that China stands ready for dialogue and consultations on EVs if the EU is willing to sit down at the negotiating table with sincerity.
Noting that Germany and China are supporters and beneficiaries of globalization, Habeck said the German government is deeply concerned about the EU's anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs, which will negatively impact Europe's green transition and consumer interests.
Habeck believes that imposing tariffs is the worst approach as it could lead to a vicious spiral of trade friction escalations, stressing that dialogue and consultations are the only way to solve such problems.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Zhong Wenxing",Economy,20240624,1408,,,Upbeat foreign companies increase in China,"BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- More and more foreign companies are increasing their investment in the gigantic market of the world's second-largest economy with optimism about the Chinese economic outlook on the rise.
In January, German luxury carmaker Audi AG launched pre-mass production at its first production base for purely electric vehicles in China.
In March, a Mercedes-Benz and BMW joint venture was established in Beijing, with plans to build at least 1,000 supercharging stations and around 7,000 high-power charging piles by 2026.
Also in March, German optical systems and optoelectronics manufacturer ZEISS' largest Quality Centre of Excellence in China opened in Dongguan City, south China's Guangdong Province.
The newly-unveiled Flash Survey by the German Chamber of Commerce in China showed that foreign companies in China are more optimistic about China's economic prospects than they were last year.
Among 186 German companies surveyed, 84 percent expected the Chinese economy to improve or maintain its performance in the next six months. More than half of the surveyed enterprises planed to increase investment in China in the next two years, and 27 percent anticipated to maintain the scale of investment.
Optimism of American investors is growing, as shown in the China Business Climate Survey Report released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China) in February.
According to the report, China's market remains significant, with half of AmCham China members viewing it as one of their top three global investment destinations, a 5 percentage points rebound. China is ""an important source of talent and innovation that helps American companies boost their global competitiveness,"" said the survey.
The report also found that although challenges remain, most members are maintaining their manufacturing or sourcing in China and expatriates have become more willing to relocate to China over the last year.
The trend can be reflected in U.S. food and beverage giant PepsiCo's latest investment in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province, northwest China.
PepsiCo broke ground on a food production base in Xi'an on June 12. This new facility, with a projected total investment of 180 million U.S. dollars, is the company's first factory in northwest China and the fifth major investment in China over the past five years.
""PepsiCo has full confidence in the high-level opening-up of the Chinese market and the high-quality development of the Chinese economy. It is committed to accelerating its investment in China,"" said Anne Tse, CEO of PepsiCo Greater China.
Industrial observers said in addition to China's vast market, resilient industrial and supply chains, constantly improving R&D, and innovation capabilities are magnets to foreign companies' investment.
Mercedes-Benz inaugurated a new building in Shanghai in April as an upgrade of its R&D center in the metropolis, with an investment of 69 million yuan (about 9.71 million U.S. dollars).
""China is one of the key drivers for technological advancement in the global automotive industry. Over the years, we have been investing heavily in local R&D, consolidating innovation strength through industry-academia-research cooperation, and driving electrification and digital transformation,"" said Hubertus Troska, member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG.
""As the most comprehensive R&D team outside Germany, the R&D network in China, anchored by 'dual innovative engines' in Beijing and Shanghai, has become a frontrunner in global innovation and the vane of future trends within the group,"" Troska added.
Maximilian Foerst, president and CEO of ZEISS Greater China, believes that China, with its open innovation system, visionary talent training strategy and policy support for industrial development, will become a major driving force shaping future technology and innovation trends.
The upbeat sentiment has been also strengthened as China's economy has sustained recovery momentum in 2024 with significant strides in cultivating new quality productive forces.
According to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics, in May, China's retail sales of consumer goods rose 3.7 percent from a year earlier, the value-added industrial output went up 5.6 percent year on year, and China's imports and exports of goods increased by 8.6 percent year on year, extending an upward recovery trend.
Since April, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Citi, Deutsche Bank and other institutions have upgraded their forecasts for China's economic growth.
The latest measures proposed by the Chinese government to promote high-standard opening-up have opened up new space for foreign firms to invest in China. The measures include reducing the number of items on the negative list for foreign investment, welcoming foreign enterprises to participate in government procurement, promoting the secure and orderly cross-border flow of data, and extending its list of visa-free countries.
According to European Business in China Business Confidence Survey 2024 released by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China in May, almost half of the surveyed companies reported some market opening. Respondents from the financial services industry are the most upbeat about market opening.
The opening of China's bank card clearing market is a case in point.

The demonstration area has become a gathering area for enterprises from SCO member states to share development opportunities in the Chinese market, and is forging ahead to build itself into a new and promising platform for Belt and Road cooperation.
The SCODA is striving to establish itself as a hub for institutional innovation.
Since its establishment, the SCODA has placed institutional innovation front and center and has reaped early fruits by pioneering more than 80 institutions.
Besides, the demonstration area has set up a comprehensive economic and trade platform to offer one-stop services covering trade, customs clearance, logistics, and finance, resolving obstacles faced by enterprises in economic and trade investment.
These achievements have proved that steadily expanding institutional opening up can facilitate trade and investment, and enhance the level of trade cooperation.
The SCODA is striving to establish itself as a new hub for economic and trade cooperation.
Based on the SCO International Hub Port and a multimodal transportation service platform covering railway, sea, air and land ports, the SCODA is working to build a convenient connectivity pattern and a manufacturing center, logistics center and product distribution center facing Northeast Asia. The SCO International Hub Port has obtained the United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations (UN/LOCODE).
Moreover, the SCODA has launched 21 international train routes and set up an overseas assembly center for China-Europe (Qilu) freight trains in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Besides, it has also opened a sub-demonstration area in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. By further enhancing infrastructure connectivity, the SCODA can provide enterprises with more opportunities and contribute to economic growth.
The SCODA is striving to maintain safe and stable industrial and supply chains.

Industrial and supply chains are important parts of modern economy, which have a significant impact on the operation of the modern economic system.
To better ensure stable industrial and supply chains of SCO member states, the SCODA has hosted the SCO Industrial and Supply Chains Forum & the SCO International Investment and Trade Expo, and launched the China-SCO Industrial Park Alliance, promoting information sharing, logistics connectivity, and project collaboration.
In addition, the SCODA has set up an area for the application of the industrial internet and built 20 export-oriented industrial clusters, including the Haier COSMOPlat Industrial Internet Ecopark. By enhancing the resilience and security of industrial and supply chains, the SCODA aims to better safeguard the common interests of all SCO member states.
The SCODA is striving to nurture high-caliber professionals.
Close economic and trade cooperation relies heavily on talents. The China-SCO Institute of Economy and Trade, which was established in 2022, serves as a practical platform to train professionals who can contribute to multilateral economic and trade cooperation among SCO member states.
So far, the institute has carried out over 180 training sessions for more than 13,800 participants from SCO member states and Belt and Road partner countries, providing practical experience tailored to their actual needs. An increasing number of professionals with expertise in international economic and trade rules and national conditions of different countries have emerged, which will further deepen the exchanges and cooperation among SCO member states.
History tells us that openness and cooperation are a major driving force behind dynamic international economic and trade activities. Looking ahead, openness and cooperation will remain essential for continued human progress.
Moving forward, the SCODA will consolidate its role as an important link in international industrial, supply and trade chains, boosting economic and trade cooperation of SCO member states. It will continue to build a pilot area for institutional innovation in two-way investment and trade among SCO member states, a gathering area for entrepreneurship and business development, and a new and promising platform for Belt and Road cooperation, so as to create a new highland for opening up in the new era.

The institutional reform in the field of science and technology is essentially forming a new production relation that is in line with the new quality productive forces, with priority given to addressing the obstacles that hinder their development, Liu Dongmei, secretary of the Party Committee of the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development, told China Economic Roundtable, an all-media talk platform hosted by Xinhua News Agency.
First introduced in 2023, new quality productive forces refer to advanced productivity freed from the traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths. It features high-tech, high efficiency and high quality.
With innovation playing the leading role, ""new quality productive forces"" has become a catchphrase in China's policymaking initiatives, promising an era marked by breakthrough innovations and comprehensive sustainability.
One crucial aspect of these reforms lies in the coordination among different departments in terms of formulating strategy, allocating resources, and the layout of major facilities to maximize the efficiency of resource utilization, as technological innovation relies heavily on the synergy among multiple factors, including technological and financial ones, Liu said.
Another focus of reform should be the alignment between central and local governments, Liu added, highlighting the pivotal role of local government in pushing technological innovation, as well as the role of central government in guiding the local bodies.
Echoing Liu's analysis, Huang Hanquan, head of the Chinese Academy of Macroeconomic Research affiliated to the National Development and Reform Commission, said institutional reforms ought to be multifaceted and comprehensive, thereby facilitating the smooth flow of high-quality factors of capital, data and talents towards high-quality productive forces.
Noting that China still falls short in terms of original and disruptive innovative achievements, Huang underscored the need to strengthen basic research by reforming the sci-tech system, optimizing the evaluation regime for research projects, and enabling researchers to wholeheartedly engage in basic research.
Another barrier to innovation lies in a lack of application of technological breakthroughs to industrial chains, said Huang, urging deeper reforms in technology services to expedite the application of technological achievements in factories and transform them into tangible productivity.
In particular, both Huang and Liu highlighted the role of talent management in driving technological innovation.
There is still room for creating a more enabling environment for innovation efforts through enhancing the long-term research evaluation regime and non-consensus projects review, as well as expanding stable funding for basic research so that the potential and vitality of talents can be stimulated, Liu said.
In a bid to nurture talents with critical and innovative thinking, Huang called for deepening the integration of science and technology, education, and talent development to enable the curriculum and talent cultivation models to better serve talent development.

""Traditional industries account for about 80 percent of the entire industrial system, serving as its cornerstone and largest base,"" Huang said.
Echoing Huang's views, Liu Dongmei, Party chief of the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development, said that without the sound development of traditional industries, the emerging and future industries might face the risks of supply chain disruption.
On the other hand, new technologies and processes arising from the development of emerging and future industries can in turn benefit traditional industries. ""We believe that they are complementary, and are able to mutually integrate with one another,"" she said.
Application scenarios of new technologies, new patterns and new business models, such as artificial intelligence, can also be used in traditional industries, while traditional industries could provide upstream and downstream support, according to Huang.
Localities should give full play to their advantages to forge competitive landmark industries through the convergence of resources, technologies, enterprises and factors, Huang added.
Fostering new quality productive forces tailored to local conditions should involve a combination of resource endowment, industrial foundation and national development plans for different regions, advancing in an orderly manner, Liu said.

Tax revenue totaled 8.0462 trillion yuan during the January-May period, down 5.1 percent year on year, with a comparable increase of about 0.5 percent after deducting the impact of special factors, according to the ministry.

The European Union (EU)'s move would not foster economic prosperity, Josep Maria Gomes, international business developer at the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce, made the remarks in a recent interview with Xinhua.
The European Commission on June 12 revealed a list of protectionist duties it would levy on imports of battery electric vehicles from China, sparking opposition and concerns from governments and businesses across Europe.
The provisional duties envisaged by the Commission on the imports of EVs from China would range from 17.4 percent to 38.1 percent.
Speaking about the tariffs on imports of Chinese EVs, Gomes said that consumers would be hurt most, adding that ""we have seen over the years how protectionism has failed to bring ... a more competitive economy, and nor does it safeguard jobs.""
""Whether it's electric cars, batteries or other types of Chinese investment, if we make it difficult for investors through the imposition of tariffs or other protectionist barriers, then we will be only hurting ourselves,"" he said.

The conference, which gathered leaders of hundreds of Chinese and Ethiopian enterprises, served as a platform to look into the extensive potential for trade and investment cooperation between the two countries.
Speaking at the event, Ethiopia's State Minister of Finance for Economic Cooperation Semereta Sewasew said Ethio-Chinese economic cooperation is based on the principles of mutual benefits, respect and trust between the two nations, greatly contributing to Ethiopia's rapid economic growth.
""Over the past two decades, Chinese firms have successfully implemented more than 70 large and medium projects including two railway projects, power substations and transmission lines and modernization of telecommunication,"" Sewasew said.
Noting that the Ethio-Chinese economic cooperation began in 1971, the state minister said Ethiopia has accomplished mega projects with the full support of China which include expressways, airport terminals and various manufacturing industries.
She said the Chinese government has been financing development projects in Ethiopia mainly in the form of grants besides lending a helping hand to green development, food security, building hospitals, and offering medical supplies.
Gebeyehu Ganga, director general of the Middle East, Asia and Pacific Affairs at the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said China's unwavering diplomatic commitment to collaborating with Ethiopia has borne fruits through the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
""China has been the largest trading partner with Ethiopia and top source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent of all FDI inflow into the country,"" Ganga said.
He said with strong support from China and other member states of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), Ethiopia's inclusion into the BRICS mechanism will undoubtedly expand its business exchanges and create larger investment opportunities in the East African country.
Yang Yihang, minister counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia, said by May 2024, Chinese enterprises had participated in more than 2,000 projects in Ethiopia, with a total investment amounting to 5 billion U.S. dollars and creating about 610,000 job opportunities.
""In the first five months of this year, Chinese enterprises invested over 200 million U.S. dollars in about 100 projects in Ethiopia, creating more than 18,000 local jobs,"" Yang said.
Indicating that Ethio-Chinese diplomatic relations elevated to the all-weather strategic partnership in October 2023, Yang said there will be a great potential for future cooperation between Beijing and Ethiopia in modern agriculture, biotechnology, infrastructure development, digital economy and operation of industrial parks.
The conference, hosted by China Council for the Promotion of International Trade Beijing Sub-Council and Beijing Chamber of International Commerce, also saw the signing of memoranda of Understanding among Chinese and Ethiopian enterprises, aiming at enhancing their business relations, exchanging data and information and organizing joint trade fairs and exhibitions in the future.

The acclaim was made on the margins of the Beijing-Ethiopia Business Cooperation Promotion Conference held Friday in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
Mesenbet Shenkute, president of the Addis Ababa Chamber of Commerce and Sectoral Association, said Chinese companies have been playing key roles in speeding up Ethiopia's economic development through building several mega infrastructure projects including railways, expressways, suspension bridges and skyline buildings.
""Chinese firms' engagement in the development of industrial parks, sugar factories, hydropower dams, wind power plants, substation and transmission lines, and many others is the outcome of the long-standing ties between Ethiopia and China,"" said Shenkute in an interview with Xinhua.
China is the major supplier of products to Ethiopia, including machinery, equipment, medicine and consumer goods while it imports a significant portion of Ethiopia's agricultural products such as coffee, leather, oil seeds and flowers, according to Shenkute.
Noting that China remains the top source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ethiopia, Shenkute said Chinese companies are investing in modern industrial parks in Ethiopia, including in the eastern industrial zone which is the catalyst for economic development and creating job opportunities for local citizens.
Semereta Sewasew, Ethiopia's state minister of Finance for Economic Cooperation, said that Ethiopia cherishes China as its strategic partner which has greatly contributed to its economic development over the past decades.
China stands tall as a strategic partner to Ethiopia, and presently Chinese companies are undertaking many investment projects amounting to nearly 5 billion U.S. dollars in Ethiopia and creating over half a million local jobs, said Sewasew.
She said Ethio-Chinese development strategies have proven to be complementary and emphasize mutual benefits, equality, fairness and inclusiveness.
The state minister called on Chinese companies to further deepen their investment engagement in Ethiopia, taking advantage of the far-reaching economic and political reforms that the government of Ethiopia has embarked on recently to attract foreign and private investments into the country.
According to the state minister, Ethiopia is keen to further strengthen its strategic partnership with China in trade and investment, green energy development, digital economy, health and other fields.

Vo, who has been working in Dongxing for 10 years, has grown accustomed to the daily cross-border commute from Vietnam to China. Through her experience, she has developed a keen understanding of Chinese customers' preferences and has gained valuable insights into the business strategies employed by local merchants.
Vo lives in Mong Cai, Vietnam, which is situated just across the river from Dongxing.
Vo's daily routine begins at 8:30 a.m. when she leaves her home and rides her motorcycle to Mong Cai port. After completing the streamlined customs clearance process, she arrives at her shop by 9 a.m. The shop operates until approximately 6 p.m., enabling Vo to return home in time to enjoy dinner with her family.
""Compared to a few years ago, the customs clearance process is much more convenient, with simplified procedures. We can travel back and forth between the two countries easily every day. Many of my friends also work in China like me,"" Vo said.
Vo's journey in Dongxing began at the age of 17. She later secured a position as a salesperson in the wholesale market, where she quickly developed a fondness for the working environment.

Recognizing the immense potential of cross-border tourism, she invested her savings in renting a shop within the wholesale market in April of last year.
""I just had to bring my border crossing card, passport, and the contract to apply for a business license, and it was a breeze. Once that was done, I got a Chinese bank card and connected it to my phone, allowing my shop to accept mobile payments,"" Vo explained.
The ease of setting up a shop in Dongxing has solidified her resolve to continue working in China and pursuing her entrepreneurial ambitions.
Nowadays, Vo has expanded her shop, offering a wide array of specialty products that include popular Vietnamese delicacies such as dried fruits and vegetables, cashews, durian pastries, and bread, as well as goods from other ASEAN countries.
Having spent a decade working in Dongxing, Vo has also nurtured several personal aspirations.
""I want to visit Shanghai and Beijing in China, especially the magnificent Great Wall!"" she said.

Wang made the remarks during a meeting with German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, the Ministry of Commerce said in a press release.
China is willing to consider both parties' reasonable concerns to avoid the escalation of trade frictions in a rational and professional manner, Wang said.
China hopes that Germany will play a positive role in the EU, prompting the European side to meet China halfway, he told Habeck, who is also the Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.
If the European side adheres stubbornly to its wrong way, China will take necessary measures, including lodging a case under the World Trade Organization dispute settlement mechanism, to firmly defend its legitimate rights and interests, Wang added.
Noting that Germany and China are supporters and beneficiaries of globalization, Habeck said the German government is deeply concerned about the EU's anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs, which will negatively impact Europe's green transition and consumer interests.
Habeck believes that imposing tariffs is the worst approach as it could lead to a vicious spiral of trade friction escalations, stressing that dialogue and consultations are the only way to solve problems.

(Xinhua)
SHANGHAI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Rather than being daunted by the European Commission's plan to impose provisional tariffs on China-made electric vehicles, Chinese carmaker SAIC Motor has found inspiration in the decision and designed an array of creative products in response.
Shao Jingfeng, chief design officer of the SAIC Motor R&D Innovation Headquarters, has released pictures on his Twitter-like Sina Weibo social media account showing products like skateboards, hoodies, sneakers, cups, umbrellas and table tennis paddles designed to mark the event.
The products are mainly yellow and black in color, and are emblazoned with the figure ""38.1"" and the EU emblem.
""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,"" Shao wrote on Sina Weibo. ""Let us remember 38.1.""
The European Commission last week unveiled its plan to levy provisional additional tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on China-made electric vehicles. SAIC Motor would be subject to the highest tariff rate.
Following the announcement, Shao posted two ""38.1"" designs and asked netizens to choose between them. About 700 people voted, and many commented to show their support.
""SAIC's sales in Europe are far ahead, and it will not be defeated by policies. On the contrary, it will become stronger with better sales!"" said one netizen, posting under the username Beibei_Riley.
""On the new race track of intelligent electric vehicle manufacturing, Chinese car companies are surging ahead,"" said another, who had the username Bryant_Yu, adding ""The tariff shows that SAIC is becoming more and more influential.""
In response to the European Commission's plan for provisional tariffs, Guan Yizhong, general manager of the Corporate Communications Department of SAIC Motor, said the company was ""deeply concerned and disappointed.""
""We believe that free trade and fair competition are key to promoting global economic prosperity and sustainable development,"" he said, noting that the ""EU's measures violate the principles of market economy and international trade rules.""
Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, said SAIC Motor's latest move shows the ability of Chinese companies to deal with crisis -- an ability that is becoming increasingly mature, and experience is being gained.
""Confronting the problem head-on and appealing to the young people on social media shows that Chinese auto companies are more confident,"" he said.
""The imposition of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles will only make the industry lose, the environment lose, and the consumers in the EU lose,"" he added.
According to SAIC Motor, the new creative products are being manufactured and will be awarded to Chinese internet users based on social media lottery draws.

""Greater cooperation with China is extremely beneficial to countries like Spain, which are open to imports but traditionally also export a great deal. In fact, the rise in our GDP is not only due to tourism but also to a rise in our exports,"" said Josep Maria Gomes, International Business Developer at the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce.
The permanent Cooperation and Dialogue Mechanism agreement signed on June 3 was the result of the 29th Spanish-Chinese Mixed Economic and Industrial Commission held in Madrid.
Gomes underlined that China is Spain's largest trading partner outside the European Union (EU). At the same time, Spain is the EU country that exports the most pork to China, which is also importing increasing amounts of Spanish wine and olive oil.
In recent years, annual bilateral trade between China and Spain has risen to over 50 billion euros (53.5 billion U.S. dollars), according to the Spanish Institute for Foreign Trade (ICEX).
""We've only lately realized the importance of China as a growing market for our products, because until now we've seen China as a supplier, and there are sectors in China that are far more technologically developed than ours that can help us become more competitive,"" said Gomes.
He underlined that as well as boosting exports to China, Spain wants to encourage Chinese investment in Spain through such bilateral agreements.
""What Spain is looking for is essential investment in such strategic areas as the auto sector or renewable energy, so it wants to show Chinese companies that they are welcome to invest here,"" he said.
According to the Spain China Council Foundation, in 2022 China invested 95 million euros in Spain, while Spain invested 42 million euros in China.
Gomes highlighted the recent agreement signed by Chinese manufacturer Chery Automobile with Spanish company Ebro-EV Motors, to develop electric vehicles in the former Nissan plant in Barcelona.
""Spain is Europe's second-largest producer of vehicles, and has a long tradition in this industry, with a large pool of providers and talent that Chinese companies wanting to invest in the Spanish market can benefit from,"" he told Xinhua.
Chinese Electric Vehicle (EV) brands have the largest market share in Spain, with 10.6 percent, behind only Sweden (13.3) and ahead of France (9.6), according to the Transport &Environment (T&E) NGO.
Concerning the decarbonization of society, Gomes pointed out that ""Spain and China are both leaders in the development and adoption of new technology"" and in the area of renewable energy, ""they are major actors that complement each other.""
Another sector that is very important to both countries is ""their reciprocal relationship in tourism, which both China and Spain are doing so much to promote,"" he added.

The shared factory is operated by a joint venture between Guangzhou WULIXING Food Technology Co., Ltd. and White Diamond Foods Limited in New Zealand. The joint venture selected dumplings as the first products that were likely to be accepted by New Zealand consumers.
Unlike the established export model of preparing ready-made food products in China and then packaging them for lengthy overseas shipment, this new approach sees Chinese companies provide production recipes and equipment, and New Zealand companies supply raw materials and technology, facilitating the local production and sale of fresher ready-made food products.
A representative of the Guangdong provincial department of agriculture and rural affairs noted that this cooperation model shrinks the production-to-consumption cycle and reduces costs, enabling overseas consumers to enjoy fresh Cantonese cuisine locally.

Improved buyer sentiments were observed in cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Hangzhou with a significant increase in inquiries and deals. While the market response has been positive, analysts said more time is needed for the policy effect to fully manifest and the sector still remains in an adjustment phase.
China on May 17 announced new policies to stimulate home purchases, ranging from lower minimum downpayment ratios and the cancellation of mortgage rate floors for first and second homes.
Moreover, local state-owned enterprises are encouraged to buy homes for affordable housing initiatives, and struggling developers may receive more financing support to complete ongoing projects and meet home delivery targets.
Recently, multiple new housing projects in Shanghai saw notable increases in subscription rates and customer visits.
In a crowded showroom in Pudong District, an unnamed sales manager said the influx of potential buyers resulted from the relaxed purchase restriction policies.
By mid-June, the city registered 14,730 existing home deals -- surpassing the average monthly level from the previous five months -- since May 28, when local favorable property measures kicked in.
In Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province, the number of second-hand home purchase contracts increased 10 percent from May 31 to June 13 on the KE Holdings Inc. platform, a leading real estate services provider.
The data was ""a positive sign that the market vitality continued to improve,"" said Shangguan Jian, president of the Hangzhou research institute of KE Holdings.
Similarly, Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province, also saw a clear recovery in the housing market. During the Dragon Boat Festival holiday from June 8 to 10, the sales of new homes stood at about 20,000 square meters each day, marking a 6 percent increase from the same period a year ago, data from the China Index Academy showed.
The market recovery in first and second-tier cities was mainly driven by robust demand from new residents and young people seeking stable homes for marriage or children's education, said Li Yujia, chief researcher at the Guangdong Housing Policy Research Center.
Li emphasized that loosening policies have unlocked accumulated purchasing power previously constrained by policy limitations, insufficient credit support, and cautious market sentiment.
As it has only been a month since this round of policies came into force, some analysts and industry insiders still anticipated further observation of the policy effects.
Wu Wenhui, a real estate agent in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, said the wait-and-see attitude still lingered among buyers. Huang Xue from the China Index Academy's Sichuan branch called on more efforts to further revitalize the market, such as improving policies on land reserves and more swiftly pushing for trade-ins of commercial homes.
The government in the next step should continue to fully implement existing policy measures and stimulate effective demand in a bid to help stabilize the housing market, said Yu Xiaofen, head of the real estate research institute at the Zhejiang University of Technology.

The exhibition, held alongside three other trade fairs from Wednesday to Friday in Munich, focused on energy transition.
Approximately 3,000 exhibitors showcased their latest products and solutions in areas such as PV modules, energy storage systems, and charging infrastructure. The event attracted around 111,000 trade visitors from across the globe.
Markus Elsaesser, founder and CEO of the exhibition organizer German Solar Promotion GmbH, noted that 976 Chinese exhibitors participated in this year's event, making China the largest participant for the first time since the exhibition's inception, followed by Germany with 934 exhibitors.
INNOVATIVE GREEN BOOSTER
Besides inverters and energy storage systems, solar panels are a main part of PV products and comprise numerous solar cell units, the core component converting light energy into electricity.
At the exhibition, Chinese company LONGI Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (LONGI) announced it had broken a record by raising the photoelectric conversion efficiency of its commercial-sized silicon-perovskite tandem solar cells to 30.1 percent, and is expected to own the technical ability for mass production in the next few years.
The technical breakthrough by LONGI epitomizes China's innovative advancements in the solar industry.
Elsaesser said he has seen a lot of innovations at the exhibition every year, which have benefited the decarbonization of the industry and society in Europe and the world. ""And that was very much driven by Chinese manufacturers, as their global market share is very high,"" he added.
According to the latest report on the global market outlook in the PV industry released by SolarPower Europe, an association for the European PV sector, Germany installed 15 GW of new PV capacity in 2023, increasing more than 100 percent year-on-year and ranking fourth in terms of new-added capacity globally.
European countries including Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands also recorded growth and were listed among the top 10 PV markets in 2023. As of last year, 14 of the 31 countries with a total PV installed capacity exceeding 1 GW are in the European Union.
Given an unprecedented scale of growth in the PV industry, ""it needs to be highlighted that most of this global market expansion was driven by and in China,"" said the report. ""Without China's strong solar investments in deployment, the solar sector's growth would have been much more modest,"" it added.
At the exhibition booth of Chinese company JA Solar Technology Co., Ltd. (JA Solar), solar panels of various powers and sizes attracted visitors and trade partners. According to the booth staff, these PV products by this company have been used in most European countries, covering a wide range of application scenarios from private houses to large factories and supermarkets.
Zhu Daocheng, vice president of JA Solar, told Xinhua that based on the overall agenda of the global energy transition, the Chinese PV industry will play an increasingly important role in the European renewable energy market.
""I am confident that, together with other Chinese companies, we could continue to perform well in the European solar market,"" he said.
WIN-WIN COOPERATION
Elsaesser views the cooperation between Chinese and European solar industries as a ""win-win"" situation.
While noting China has built up a complete value chain in its PV industry from the raw materials to the final products on a big scale, he said the country has helped Europe and even the world to get the competitive products they need for green transition goals.
Chinese companies can also deepen their business in Europe through further cooperation like local production. ""Therefore, I think it is good to have cooperation and not to raise any barriers between countries and regions,"" Elsaesser added.
In the view of Qu Shuaiyuan, CEO of the Beny New Energy GmbH headquartered in China, a number of European countries like Germany, France, and Spain are gifted with plenty of sunshine and have huge demands and potential for solar power utilization given the large number of single-family houses in these countries. The company has expanded its market in Europe through deepening cooperation with business partners in these countries to provide solar systems and solutions for balconies and roofs of local houses.
According to reports released this week by the German Solar Association, more than 60 percent of private house owners in Germany have shown interest in investing in a solar power system. The association noted that the PV industry in Germany is experiencing a special economic boom in the area of residential solar power, as well as ""a small energy revolution on domestic balconies.""
""Although this kind of distributed solar device in a single family can generate limited power, the cumulative volume of countless families in Europe is considerable,"" said Qu.
German company Axitec Energy is a leading solar module provider in Europe. It has cooperated with Chinese manufacturers for years by producing PV products in China and serving the European continent.
Cristina Lovato, marketing manager at Axitec Energy, said that with its value chain advantages, China's PV industry has helped promote green transition in Europe.
Dennis She, vice president of LONGI, said in an interview with Xinhua during the exhibition that he is optimistic about the continued participation and contribution of Chinese companies in the European renewable energy market through cooperation.
""Europe is committed to achieving the goal of energy transition, and related Chinese companies, with their expertise and experience, could provide high-quality PV solutions for Europe and help boost its renewable energy development through international cooperation and joint efforts,"" She said.

People.cn,"Tian Yi, Liang Jun",Economy,20240624,842,,,Economy to stay on upward trajectory amid headwinds,"China's economy will maintain its upward growth trajectory this year amid rising trade protectionism and economic uncertainties, with huge potential in rural consumption, manufacturing, and opening-up to be further tapped, according to the World Economic Forum.
Chen Liming, chair of Greater China at the WEF, a Switzerland-based international organization, said that China's positive economic outlook remains unchanged in the long term, given the country's massive market advantage, rich talent pool, and complete and stable industrial chain.
""China remains a massive consumer market where regional and rural development represents huge opportunities. The country's production and manufacturing systems are still upgrading, which also represents further significant growth,"" Chen told China Daily in an exclusive interview.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that China's retail sales — a key gauge of consumer spending — rose 3.7 percent year-on-year in May, while industrial output grew 5.6 percent during the period.
Chen made the remarks ahead of the upcoming 15th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions, also known as the Summer Davos Forum, which will be held in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning province, from Tuesday to Thursday.
Chen said that more efforts should be made to ensure policies are continuously ""stable, transparent and predictable"", in order to further stabilize the nation's growth momentum.
""Such sustainable policies are expected to greatly boost the confidence of entrepreneurs so that growth momentum of vertical industries can be further consolidated,"" he added.
Chen said he believes that a longer-term path lies in adhering to the country's reform and opening-up agenda, as it improves its socialist market economy. ""The market is expected to continue to play a decisive role in resource allocation in the country, which will continue to offer a level playing field and a fair policy environment for all businesses.""
For instance, Dalian, where the Summer Davos has been held seven times, has striven to build a new frontier for foreign investment in China's northeastern region, Chen said.
""The city and the province have attracted an increasing number of foreign enterprises by improving the business environment and making it more international, convenient, and law-abiding,"" he said.
In addition, the Summer Davos has provided Liaoning with opportunities for deeper exchanges with the international community and a window for learning new technologies and expertise, according to Chen.
""Dalian city and Liaoning province are also able to showcase their economic development achievements, which will promote the internationalization of their economy,"" he said.
China has taken steps to expand opening-up, including rolling out national and pilot free trade zone versions of the negative list for cross-border trade in services and simplifying visa applications.
However, the world's second-largest economy has recently faced protectionist measures taken by its major trade partners.
The European Commission has said it will apply additional duties on imported Chinese-made electric vehicles starting next month. The United States has also tried to suppress China's ""new three"" industries — new energy vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and photovoltaic products — by raising taxes and hyping so-called ""overcapacity"".
""Using a 'big stick' of sanctions to deal with trade disputes will not yield good results. Trade disputes arise from trade imbalances and should be resolved through dialogue and negotiations,"" Chen said.
He added that it is obviously due to differences in resource endowment, technological levels, and worker skills that some countries have gained more competitive advantages than others, not because of the so-called production or capacity problem.

People.cn,"Tian Yi, Liang Jun",Economy,20240624,840,,,FTZs help foreign firms thrive,"In 2018, Zeeshan Qasim Khan, a Pakistani student who had just graduated from Hainan Medical University, was planning to start an international trade venture in Guangdong province, China's leading economic powerhouse.
Khan's initial plans, which focused on importing Pakistani rice, carpets, and handicrafts to China, and exporting Chinese electronics, medical equipment, and marbles to global markets, changed course following a pivotal announcement by President Xi Jinping.
During the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of Hainan province and the Hainan Special Economic Zone in April 2018, Xi unveiled ambitious plans to transform the entire island into a pilot free trade zone and eventually establish a free trade port with unique Chinese characteristics.
This announcement convinced Khan that he should remain in Hainan and capitalize on the emerging opportunities.
Six years later, the decision was fully vindicated, Khan said, highlighting the preferential corporate and individual income tax policies as primary advantages of the Hainan Free Trade Port.
""The tax benefits are substantial, and we get more benefits in our businesses,"" Khan noted, referring to the 15 percent corporate income tax rate for enterprises in encouraged industries within the FTP, which is significantly lower than the usual 20 percent to 25 percent.
Khan's company, located in the Haikou Fullsing Internet Industrial Park, is among the numerous foreign businesses that have benefited from China's growing openness to the global market and from sound supply and industrial chains, as the nation develops a network of free trade zones.
In September 2013, China launched its first FTZ in Shanghai, marking a significant milestone in the country's reform and opening-up.
The Shanghai FTZ introduced the first negative list for foreign investment, which was a radical departure from the previous method of listing sectors where foreign investment was encouraged. A negative list indicates the areas in which investment is prohibited or restricted; all other areas are presumed to be open.
President Xi, who has been at the helm of these reforms, emphasized the importance of FTZs in driving the nation's economic agenda.
""On this new journey, we must build higher-level free trade zones based on a comprehensive summary of the past decade's experience,"" he said in an instruction in September, urging continued innovation and exploration in broader and deeper areas.
During the annual session of the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature, in 2014, Xi stressed the need for FTZs to align with international investment and trade rules, enhance the institutional system and regulatory model, and balance market-driven resource allocation with effective government intervention.
He called for boldness and innovation, aiming to develop replicable and scalable new systems to facilitate investment and trade, ensure efficient regulation and establish a standardized legal environment.
China has so far established 22 FTZs, which contributed to about 18.4 percent of the nation's total import and export volume in 2023. The Hainan Free Trade Port has introduced over 120 innovative policies to date.
Some analysts underlined Xi's vision for the FTZs, which served as a springboard for bold experimentation and systemic reform.
Gu Xueming, president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, wrote in a co-authored report in November, ""The achievements of the past decade in the pilot FTZs prove that these zones have become pioneering forces of high-level openness, trailblazers of deep-seated reforms, models of high-quality development, and important platforms for serving national strategies.""
He explained that the FTZs in China have come up with pioneering initiatives making them bold leaders in the country's reform and opening-up, including the implementation of negative lists for market entry and cross-border trade in services.
The FTZs were also home to China's first wholly foreign-owned public fund management company and its first wholly foreign-owned automobile manufacturing enterprise.
In the realm of deepening reforms, China's FTZs have consistently embraced bold experimentation and innovation, achieving significant breakthroughs in trade, investment, finance, and government functions, he said.
In Shandong province, the establishment of an FTZ has significantly spurred the inflow of foreign investment and boosted efforts to improve the business environment.
Cui Linxian, an executive with SITC International Holdings Co, a Hong Kong-based shipping logistics company, highlighted the alignment of the zone's innovative spirit with the company's entrepreneurial ethos.
The robust port infrastructure in Qingdao, the second-largest foreign trade port in China, provides an ideal environment for business growth, he said.
He added that the Shandong FTZ aims to establish a world-class business environment, which has underpinned the company's efforts to enhance its core competitive edge.
""The authorities in the FTZ have continually simplified procedures and improved efficiency, adhering to a proactive service approach that shortens the path for enterprises to conduct their business,"" Cui said.
""By focusing on the needs of businesses as both the starting point and ultimate goal, multiple departments have collaborated to promote the integration of services into a unified one-stop.""
Khan, the Pakistani national, also praised the introduction of favorable policies and one-stop services designed to attract and support foreigners living and working in Hainan, particularly those eager to engage in business activities despite language barriers.
""These measures simplify crucial processes such as work permits, visas, and residency requirements, enhancing overall convenience and efficiency,"" he added.
Khan said he believes that, as one of the world's largest free trade ports, the Hainan FTP will attract more young talent to the island province, promoting local economic and trade development.
He has shared information about the preferential policies and vast opportunities in the Hainan FTP with friends in Pakistan and other countries, many of whom are considering relocating to Hainan to work and invest.
Wang Ying, a researcher at the Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics' Academy of China Open Economy Studies, underscored the importance of the FTZ strategy in China's high-level opening-up agenda going forward.
Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said in his report to the 20th National Congress of the CPC in October 2022 that the nation will work faster to develop the Hainan Free Trade Port, upgrade pilot FTZs, and expand the globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas.
Wang said the nation's FTZs will take on an even greater historical mission by coordinating deep reforms and high-level openness. ""The focus of FTZs should be on exploring deeper and broader reforms in key areas such as trade, investment, finance, and cross-border data flows,"" she said.
By expanding the scope and depth of pioneering reforms, the FTZs will enrich the application of free trade policies and amplify their benefits, Wang added.
By advancing institutional openness through rules, regulations, management and standards, FTZs will serve as comprehensive experimental platforms for reform and opening-up, which will support China's accession to high-standard international trade agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, she added.

BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- In a sheet-steel plant of China Baowu Steel Group Corporation in Xinyu, east China's Jiangxi Province, robots and three unmanned intelligent vehicles are busy working in the dark, delivering rolls of steel from the warehouse.
Both the unmanned intelligent vehicles and robots work 24 hours a day, lifting 7,000 tonnes of steel rolls daily, according to Hu Hua, a worker at the plant. The tonnage has been increased by 120 percent per hour, while the loss rate has dropped by more than 90 percent, saving more than 180,000 yuan (roughly 25,000 U.S. dollars) each year.
Meanwhile, the traditional iron-making workshop at the plant has also achieved an intelligent transformation, with computers effortlessly managing crucial tasks like adjusting furnace temperatures and airflow for molten-iron smelting.
Jin Hongbing, a veteran at the workshop, said the smart transition of the whole operation process has effectively improved the production efficiency. ""About 2.6 million yuan can be saved annually by reducing the failure rate,"" said Jin.
Such changes have been brought about by a centralized control center. The status and index data of production lines, including energy consumption and the carbon emissions, are displayed in real time on a big screen. It helps shorten the steel-roll production process from one hour to 10 minutes.
""Digitization and intelligent technologies have helped realize accurate management and efficient coordination of production, purchasing, logistics and sales,"" said Liu Jianrong, chief representative of Jiangxi Headquarters of Baowu.
Baowu's story provides an illustration of the broader intelligent transformation and high-quality upgrading of China's traditional manufacturing and production industries.
China is striving to foster and strengthen new quality productive forces through the deep integration of sci-tech innovation and industrial upgrading, so as to accelerate the creation of new dynamics for high-quality development.
As the technology intensity continues to improve, the added value of the country's equipment manufacturing industry has steadily increased.
In recent years, the average annual growth rate of the added value of high-tech manufacturing and equipment manufacturing has reached about 10 percent, significantly higher than the average level of all industries above the designated size.
GREEN DEVELOPMENT
Not only are traditional industries such as steel and non-ferrous metals extensively applying digital and intelligent technologies, but emerging industries like big-data storage and processing, information and communication, bio-manufacturing and new energy vehicles are also establishing new examples of modernized production and industrial intelligence in this era.
An energy big-data project is under construction in Guiyang, southwest China's Guizhou Province. The project's first 500 10kW cabinets are expected to be put into operation by the end of this year.
""We aim to build a green, energy-saving, shared, open and internationally leading energy data center,"" said Wang Junhao, project manager from a power-grid big-data services company based in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
Green development is taking shape on a large scale in almost all economic and social sectors, including infrastructure, energy, transportation, construction, architecture, tourism and waste management.
By the end of 2023, China's cumulative installed capacity of wind power and photovoltaic energy reached 1.05 billion kilowatts, accounting for 40 percent of the world's total installed capacity of new energy, while almost 9.5 million new energy vehicles were sold, topping the world for nine consecutive years.
Besides, China has set up 3,657 green factories, 270 green industrial parks, 408 green supply-chain enterprises, promoting nearly 30,000 green products.

It can promptly heed the call for coffee, waving its arms to perform each step: taking beans, grinding, steeping and brewing. In no time, another fragrant cup of coffee is presented to a delighted attendee.
It utilizes 3,000 hours of Artificial Intelligence (AI) learning and 30,000 hours of robotic arm training to replicate the techniques of an experienced barista.
""AI is accelerating its deep integration with various industries, giving birth to new fields and tracks that will lead future development, achieving a revolutionary upgrade in productivity and production efficiency,"" said Long Teng, vice minister of science and technology.
With the support of AI tools, more sci-fi scenarios, such as self-driving vehicles shuttling back and forth, robot arms picking vegetables and automatic micro-nano 3D printing applied on chips, are becoming a reality in China.
AI serves as one of the major catalysts for future industries, which are considered to contain infinite possibilities of sci-tech innovation and represent the high-quality development trend of the future.
In recent years, local governments in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang have all issued policies and documents to cultivate future industries. The development of innovative products such as humanoid robots, quantum computers, brain-computer interfaces, 6G network equipment, ultra-large new intelligent computing centers and advanced aviation equipment have been actively planned in many places across the country.
The forming of new quality productive forces cannot be separated from the growth of strategic emerging industries and future industries.
By 2025, some fields of China's future industries are expected to reach the international advanced level, said Bai Jie, an official with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, noting that by 2027, the comprehensive strength of the country's future industries will be significantly improved and the key core technologies will make remarkable breakthroughs.

People.cn,"Xue Yanyan, Zhong Wenxing",Economy,20240622,1005,,,China eyes greater input on global NEV standards,"BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Friday announced plans to formulate new standards for the global auto industry, focusing on new energy vehicles (NEVs) and intelligent connected vehicles.
The ministry has released a document detailing the key areas of automotive standardization work for 2024, which notes that China will take the lead in advancing the formulation of nearly 20 international standards, including those for fuel cell vehicles, electromagnetic compatibility and automotive radar.
Additionally, China aims to create at least three new international standards for electric vehicle (EV) performance-testing methods and collision safety terminology, and establish one to two international standards working groups.
China will continue to fulfill its duties as the convener of nine working groups, including those covering auto perception sensors and autonomous driving test scenarios.
The country will also spearhead the development of global technical regulations for autonomous driving systems, and expedite the formulation of regulations on maximum EV power measurement methods and the second phase of power battery durability, the ministry said.
The document also calls for boosted numbers of standards in the field of automotive chips.
Looking back on the history of the global auto industry, it is clear that pivotal events have shaped new standards and propelled the industry forward. Notable examples include the invention of seat belts and the promotion of the New Car Assessment Program.
Over the decades, international standardization organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Automotive Task Force have played a crucial role in fostering technological innovation, industrial upgrading and trade.
China is proactively implementing a standardization strategy to ensure standards drive innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development.
In April 2018, China proposed an international standard for autonomous driving test scenarios to a road vehicles committee under the ISO, which led to the establishment of a working group that was convened by China.
Through collaboration with experts from over 20 countries, including Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the United States, a series of international standards projects were planned around autonomous driving test scenarios.
In October 2022, the first international standard in the field of autonomous driving test scenarios, ISO 34501, was officially released following work that was led by China.
In November 2022, China established an automotive standardization research institute to undertake such tasks as representing the country in efforts to coordinate and formulate international automotive standards at the United Nations (UN) and within other international regulatory bodies.
In 2023, China's production and sales of NEVs ranked first globally for a ninth consecutive year. The country's intelligent connected vehicle applications have been expanding, and its technological innovation has shown tremendous vitality.
China's auto industry has accumulated extensive practical experience in the construction of basic scenario libraries, road testing, demonstration applications, and the research and development of intelligent connected vehicles and key system components, placing it at the forefront of the global auto sector.
The ministry has pledged incentives for simultaneous proposals of national and international standards projects to enhance consistency. Increased efforts will also be made to produce foreign-language versions of national automotive standards.
On cutting-edge technology, the ministry noted the need for forward-looking research on corresponding standards subsystems for new areas such as solid-state batteries, EV battery-swapping and auto-related artificial intelligence.
International partnerships will be expanded, the ministry said, highlighting the role of established multilateral and bilateral dialogue mechanisms.

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun",Economy,20240621,1615,,,China eyes new rules on fair competition reviews to ensure level playing field,"BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China will bring regulations for fair competition reviews into force from August 1 to help ensure a level playing field for all market players and build a unified domestic market free from regional protectionist practices, according to the country's top market watchdog.
The regulations aim to prevent authorities from rolling out measures that exclude or restrict market competition, Zhou Zhigao, an official of the State Administration for Market Regulation, told a press conference Friday.
When formulating laws, rules and policies related to business activities, the authorities will be required to conduct such reviews over several aspects, including market entry or exit, the free flow of goods, and business operation costs and practices, Zhou said.
For instance, official policies should not contain unreasonable or discriminatory conditions on market access, or restrict the entry of products from the outside into the local market. Without legal support or the approval of the State Council, authorities are forbidden to grant specific businesses tax breaks or give selective or differentiated incentives or subsidies.
To safeguard the autonomy of business operation, governments are prohibited to illegally interfere with the price levels that should be regulated by the market or exceed its legal authority to set guided prices.
Attaching great importance to fair competition, China has rolled out an array of measures to eliminate market barriers and make sure that all types of capital can have equal opportunities, fair market access, and orderly competition.
A fair competition review system was established in 2016 and the country has stepped up efforts to build a better business environment. Over the past eight years, some 93,000 policies and measures that limit competition have been abolished or revised, and many practices that hinder fair access and restrict free flows of factors have been corrected.
The formation of the new regulations marks a milestone, another official of the administration Xu Xinjian said.
China will be able to build a more solid foundation for the unified domestic market of fair competition, ensure that favorable policies for all business entities will be fairer, and further improve its market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment, Xu said.

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun",Economy,20240621,1516,,,China slams European Commission for demanding commercial secrets in EV probe,"China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on Thursday slammed the European Commission (EC)'s investigation into Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, in which the EC demanded a huge amount of information related to the firms' commercial secrets. MOFCOM reiterated its vow to take all necessary measures to defend Chinese firms' rights and interests.
Chinese carmakers have called for strong countermeasures, including considering raising the temporary tariff rate on imported cars with large-displacement engines, while relevant domestic industries have requested or plan to request investigations into certain EU products, including pork and dairy. Chinese officials have vowed to take all necessary measures to defend the rights and interests of Chinese businesses.
Meanwhile, a recent survey showed that Chinese businesses' confidence in the EU market has plunged sharply following the EC's investigation into Chinese EVs and subsequent punitive tariffs. The EC's move has seriously undermined China-EU cooperation and will deal a serious blow to the EU's struggling economy, Chinese experts said.
Asked about a closed-door meeting between major Chinese and European carmakers, where the relevant firms said that the EC demanded trade secrets about the Chinese EV industry, He Yadong, a spokesperson for MOFCOM, said that the EC requested a large amount of information on the production and operation, development plans, technical processes, product formulas and other information from Chinese EV and battery companies.
""The type, scope and quantity of information collected by the EU side is unprecedented and far exceeds what is needed for countervailing investigations,"" He said at a press conference on Thursday, while also slamming the EC's punitive tariffs based on claims that Chinese firms did not cooperate. ""Chinese companies were shocked and very disappointed.""
He reiterated that the EC's move lacks any factual and legal basis, violates WTO rules, disrupts fair competition and undermines the global green transition and open cooperation. ""China firmly opposes this and will take all necessary measures to resolutely defend the rights and interests of Chinese companies.""
On Tuesday, major Chinese and European carmakers held a closed-door meeting, during which Chinese carmakers and industry associations deplored the EC's ruling against Chinese EVs and urged the government to take strong countermeasures, including considering raising the temporary tariff rate on imported cars with large-displacement engines, a source told the Global Times.
European carmakers that attended the meeting also expressed opposition to the EC's move to impose additional tariffs on Chinese EVs, and hoped that China and the EU will start negotiations as soon as possible to avoid escalation in China-EU trade tensions, said the source who attended the meeting.
While MOFCOM did not announce specific countermeasures, the spokesperson also offered updates on Chinese investigations into EU products. China has completed various procedures in its anti-dumping probe into brandy from the EU, and will make rulings based on the investigation, He said.
Asked whether MOFCOM will launch an investigation into dairy products from the EU following its probe into certain pork and pig by-products from the EU, He said that MOFCOM has noted the requests made by relevant industries, which have the right to apply for investigations under Chinese laws and WTO rules. Investigation authorities will review applications filed by domestic industries and launch an investigation when the conditions for a probe is met, the spokesperson said.
MOFCOM on Mondayannounced that at the request of the Chinese domestic industry, it will launch an anti-dumping investigation into certain pork and pig by-products originating from the EU. In addition to the anti-dumping investigation into certain EU pork and pig by-products, the Global Times has also learned from a business insider that relevant Chinese industries are preparing evidence, as they plan to apply to competent authorities to launch an anti-subsidy investigation into imports of certain dairy products from the EU.
Major blow to EU economy
Meanwhile, a survey released by the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU (CCCEU), the main Chinese business group in the bloc, showed that 82 percent of surveyed companies said the EU's anti-subsidy probe has led to a decline in confidence in investing in Europe. More than 70 percent said that the EC's investigation negatively impacted sales in Europe, according to the result of the survey shared with the Global Times on Thursday.
""Since the start of the investigation, there has been a noticeable detriment to the sales and reputation of Chinese new energy vehicle enterprises operating within Europe. This adverse situation has eroded the confidence of Chinese automotive manufacturers in their European ventures, negatively impacting the European commercial environment,"" the CCCEU said.
Chinese experts said that the EC's move has seriously undermined business confidence in the EU's market and the foundation for China-EU economic and trade cooperation, which will deal a serious blow to the EU's already struggling economy.
Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that if the EU joins the US in its years-long trade disputes against China, it will have a profoundly negative impact on the EU's economy in the long term.
""Due to political considerations, the EC disregarded the consequences for its economy, including jobs, inflation and growth. Essentially, it is picking up a stone to smash its feet,"" Bai told the Global Times on Thursday, adding that China will take resolute countermeasures if the EC starts a trade dispute.
Some Western media reports said that the EC's protectionist move opens a new front in the West's trade disputes with China, which the US started a few years ago. However, just as the US' trade war failed to contain China, an EU trade dispute with China will wreak further havoc on the EU's economy, which is already struggling from multiple challenges, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Chinese experts said.
""The US' tariffs and other measures against China were made out of political, strategic and security considerations, and disregards economic interests. In comparison, the EU should not be impulsive and instead should consider the broad and direct economic benefits brought by its close relationship with China,"" Cui Hongjian, a professor from the Academy of Regional and Global Governance with Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday.
Cui said that there are major differences between the US and EU economies, and blindly following the US' step of launching a trade dispute with China would make the EU the biggest loser.
While the US has benefited greatly from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and relies on its dollar hegemony to prop up its economy, the European economy is in serious trouble. In 2023, the European economy saw close to zero growth, and some media outlets said that some EU countries face the risk of falling off an economic cliff.

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun",Economy,20240621,1515,,,Rules for fair competition reviews fill legislative gap in China’s fair competition review system: SAMR,"Just-introduced regulations for fair competition reviews have filled the legislative gap in China's fair competition review system, the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) said on Friday, noting the rules marked that the country has basically formed an anti-monopoly legal system with Chinese characteristics, and with a relatively complete content and a sound system.
Peng Xinmin, an official of the SAMR, made the remarks at a press conference on Friday, noting that the rules, for the first time, provide comprehensive, systematic and detailed provisions on the objects, standards, mechanisms, supervision and safeguards of fair competition reviews in the form of administrative regulations.
From August 1, administrative agencies and organizations legally authorized to manage public affairs must conduct fair competition reviews when formulating laws, rules and policies related to business activities, according to the regulations.
The purpose of establishing a fair competition review system in China is to prevent the introduction of measures that exclude or restrict competition, in a bid to create a favorable environment for fair competition among all types of business entities, Zhou Zhigao, an official of the SAMR, said during the press conference.
While allocating duties to both central and local government departments, the regulations outline specific standards for fair competition reviews. For instance, relevant contents that could restrict market entry or exit, and the free flow of goods and business operations should not be contained in the new policy measures, Zhou said.
The regulations also stress that stakeholders and public opinions should be taken into account during reviews to safeguard their interests.
In its new development paradigm, China prioritizes the establishment of a unified national market characterized by high efficiency, standardization, openness, and fair competition.
We have fully implemented the fair competition review system, and since its implementation, nearly 1.62 million policies and measures have been reviewed nationwide, with 4.47 million documents cleaned up and 93,000 policies and measures that exclude or restrict competition repealed and revised, according to Zhou.
We believe that with the full implementation of the regulations, the foundation of the fair competition system for accelerating the construction of a unified national market will be more solid, the policies and measures benefiting all kinds of business entities will be more equitable, and the level of China's business environment will be further upgraded, the administration noted.

China will take all necessary measures to firmly defend the legitimate rights of its companies, said the Ministry of Commerce on Thursday, in the wake of the European Union's unfounded actions to slap hefty tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars.
Brussels' protectionist actions are in utter disregard for the cooperation of Chinese firms extended during the probe, and discourage governments and industries of EU member states, besides straining ties between the bloc and the world's second-largest economy, officials and executives said.
The European Commission has demanded a substantial amount of information regarding development plans, technological processes and product formulations of Chinese EV and battery companies, said He Yadong, a spokesman for the ministry, at a news conference.
The scope, scale and quantity of information requested by the EC are unprecedented and far exceed the requirements of an antisubsidy investigation, He said.
Despite that, consequent to Brussels' decision to launch the probe, the Chinese government has engaged in extensive communications with the EU and its member states, including Germany and France, in multiple forms, like face-to-face meetings, official talks and written correspondences over 80 times, the ministry said.
Beijing has actively sought avenues for open communication and constructive engagement with Brussels, fully demonstrating its sincerity and willingness to seek win-win solutions, said Xu Hongcai, deputy director of the China Association of Policy Science's Economic Policy Committee.
Though Chinese enterprises cooperated with the EU's probe to the extent possible and provided information as required, Brussels still decided to impose punitive tariffs, He said.
From next month, the EU will impose additional tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, ranging from 17.4 percent for BYD to 38.1 percent for SAIC, on top of the standard 10 percent car duty, unless Beijing agrees to an effective solution to so-called subsidies that the EU claims are distorting its markets.
The EU's move to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese EVs is a blatant protectionist measure and a politically motivated decision, said Jian Junbo, deputy director of the Center for China-Europe Relations at Fudan University's Institute of International Studies.
The basis and procedures for this decision do not align with the World Trade Organization's rules, and its consequences could prove detrimental to the stable and healthy development of China-EU relations, Jian said, adding that the EU's protectionist measures run counter to the global trend of globalization and ultimately hinder the innovation and global competitiveness of European EV manufacturers.
The European automobile industry, however, has not submitted any applications to the European Commission requesting the investigations. On the contrary, European car manufacturers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen have expressed their opposition to Brussels' actions.
Oliver Zipse, CEO of BMW, said in a statement that the adoption of protectionist measures like tariffs could trigger a cycle of retaliation, leading to a breakdown of cooperative trade relations.
On Monday, Beijing opened an antidumping investigation into pork imports from the EU and is also reviewing applications seeking an antisubsidy probe into the bloc's dairy products.
In addition, an antidumping investigation launched in January into brandy imported from the EU is moving forward.
Governments of various EU member states also voiced their concerns that protectionist moves of the EC may cripple fair global competition.
""The European Commission's punitive tariffs hit German companies and their top products,"" German Transport Minister Volker Wissing said on the social media platform X. ""Cars must become cheaper through more competition, open markets and significantly better business conditions in the EU, not through trade war and market isolation.""
Hungarian Minister for National Economy Marton Nagy condemned the move as overly protectionist in a statement. ""We do not agree with the brutal European punitive tariffs on Chinese electric car manufacturers; excessive protectionism is not the solution.""
The commission's decision would unfairly discriminate against Chinese manufacturers and disrupt market competition, which had been vital for the European Union, Nagy said.
In addition to the probe into Chinese electric cars, Brussels has resorted to a series of trade and investment restrictions on China since October last year. In all, 41 measures have been taken, with an estimated combined value of $28.4 billion, according to China's Commerce Ministry.
These measures have been accompanied by intense investigations under the pretext of the Foreign Subsidy Regulation and International Procurement Instrument, severely affecting Chinese companies' economic activities in Europe and undermining China-EU economic cooperation.

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun",Economy,20240621,1427,,,China's NEV penetration to hit new high of 49.1 pct in June: survey,"BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The penetration rate of new energy vehicles (NEVs) in China, a gauge of popularity, is expected to hit a new high of 49.1 percent in June, as the market continues to grow steadily amid intensifying competition, an industry survey showed Thursday.
NEV manufacturers have a relatively optimistic target for June, with retail expected to reach 860,000 units, a 6.9 percent increase compared to May, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) which covers all domestic passenger car manufacturers.
Carmakers have carried out various promotional and marketing activities to hit the semi-annual target, CPCA said, adding that the strategy of trading price for volume has a very limited stimulating effect on the overall market.
The NEV penetration rate refers to the proportion of NEV sales in the total vehicle sales within a certain period. In 2020, China set the goal for NEVs to become mainstream, aiming for them to account for more than 50 percent of total auto sales by 2035. It now appears likely to achieve this goal nine or ten years ahead of schedule.
The Chinese market has entered a new phase of commercialization, increasingly propelled by technology innovation and evolving consumer preferences. The rapid development of the NEV industry is closely related to constant technological advancements in batteries and motors, contributing to the electrification and popularization of NEVs.
With advanced technologies such as intelligent driving and generative artificial intelligence (AI), NEVs can offer better intelligent service experience.
NEV penetration in China is projected to reach nearly 70 percent by 2030, with Chinese auto companies likely to rank among the top ten global sellers, according to a report released at China EV100 Forum 2024.
CPCA's preliminary estimates suggest that the total retail sales of narrow passenger cars in June is about 1.75 million units, an increase of 2.3 percent month on month.

BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A significant presence of Chinese-language advertisements at the European Football Championships has recently ignited a widespread discussion on Chinese social media.
Chinese viewers have been frequently exposed to these advertisements, such as Chinese automaker BYD and payment service platform Alipay, during live broadcasts of the tournament.
While virtual advertising solutions have contributed to the effect, the presence of Chinese companies is prominent at Euro 2024 with five out of the total 13 top sponsors coming from China.

Discussions about ""Chinese companies going global"" surged on Chinese social media platform Weibo, having attracted over 100 million views and tens of thousands of comments.
Many Chinese netizens remarked that ""seeing so many familiar companies was like watching the Chinese Super League"".
This is the first time that the championship has used virtual real-time advertising techniques, which can replace the advertisements on the LED boards surrounding the pitch with tailor-made display targeting specific markets on live-streaming.
Audiences from host Germany and the United States will also see customized advertisements in German and English.

For the European football governing body UEFA, the introduction of the new technology has opened up new possibilities for market development in the high-profile event.
As a Euro 2024 top sponsor, Chinese Ant Group showcased brands such as Alipay and Ant Fortune to the Chinese audience in Chinese, while promoting its global brands Alipay+, WorldFirst and Antom to international fans in English.
""This is included in our sponsorship benefits and it's a natural choice to promote different brands to different markets,"" said a spokesman from Ant Group.
Non-sponsors will have to buy separate virtual advertising rights.

Targeting China's vast market, international sponsors such as Qatar Tourism and Booking.com also chose to use Mandarin for their advertisements to Chinese viewers.
""This reflects the financial strength of Chinese companies and the importance of the Chinese market,"" commented a Chinese web user.
Sponsoring the championship has always been seen as a worthwhile investment by large corporations.
In the year of Euro 2016, the Chinese consumer electronics giant Hisense reportedly saw market sales in Europe increase by nearly 35 percent, with sales in host country France soaring by almost 300 percent.

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun",Economy,20240620,1703,,,China's advertisement industry maintains sound growth in 2023,"BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's advertisement industry registered rapid expansion in 2023, with the market scale continuing to rank the world's second, the State Administration for Market Regulation said Thursday.
The combined business revenue of major companies and public institutions in the sector gained 17.5 percent year on year to approximately 1.31 trillion yuan (about 184 billion U.S. dollars) last year, according to the administration.
The index measuring the development of China's advertisement industry came in at 119 points last year, up 9.1 percent from the previous year, said the administration.
The internet advertising business maintained a rapid growth momentum last year, accounting for nearly 80 percent of the total, according to the administration.

BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A novel scene is taking place during this year's lychee season, with drones shuttling back and forth on the first low-altitude air route connecting south China's Hainan and Guangdong provinces, bringing freshly picked fruit to foodies much faster.
Phoenix Wings, a cargo drone company under China's express delivery giant SF Group, initiated the interprovincial drone-delivery service for fresh fruit across the Qiongzhou Strait in late May, using the Fengzhou-90 drones developed by SF itself.
This new mode of transport is 70 percent quicker and 30 percent cheaper than conventional cross-sea transport, enhancing the freshness of the lychees and the economic benefits on all sides, according to Phoenix Wings.
In addition to the lychee delivery route between Hainan's capital Haikou and Guangdong's coastal city Zhanjiang, Phoenix Wings said it plans to develop more routes for the delivery of tea, cherry and other time-sensitive seasonal agricultural products.
The burgeoning drone-delivery field is a microcosm of China's growing low-altitude economy, which has led to the development and application of various types of innovative aerial vehicles for logistics, commuting, tourism and even sports.
The low-altitude economy covers a chain of industries, including aircraft research and development, infrastructure construction and operation, and services for flight activities.
It is estimated that the market size of the low-altitude economy sector will surge from over 500 billion yuan (70.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 2023 to 2 trillion yuan by 2030, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).

FRESH VITALITY
Chongqing, a mountainous municipality in southwest China, intends to introduce diverse recreational activities related to low-altitude sports and tourism. These activities include parachuting, paragliding and sightseeing over the Yangtze River and the cityscape of Chongqing by balloon, helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft.
In March, it launched an interprovincial low-altitude air route to the city of Zigong in neighboring Sichuan Province for trial operation, with scheduled flights expected to start in the second half of this year.
Looking ahead, Chongqing plans to open at least two low-altitude air routes for tourists to enjoy aerial views of the city's landmarks.
As a pilot city of the country's low-altitude airspace management reform, Chongqing is also gearing up to extend low-altitude flights to the fields of logistics delivery, urban management and emergency rescue, according to the Chongqing economic and information commission.
Southern China's Hainan Island has recently become a hotspot for air-sports enthusiasts, as skydiving from either a helicopter or a fixed-wing airplane has surged in popularity among Chinese sports fans.
""In recent years, Hainan has deepened the reform of low-altitude airspace management, creating a favorable policy environment for air sports,"" said Ma Chao, a researcher at Hainan Normal University.

SCALING UP PRODUCTION
Innovative Chinese aerial vehicle developers are also energized by the surge of passion for the low-altitude economy. In April, drone maker EHang Holdings Limited obtained the production certificate for its EH216-S passenger-carrying autonomous aerial vehicle system from the CAAC.
It is the first such certificate issued in China, and also the first in the global electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) industry.
The production certificate is a milestone for EHang, which is thus allowed to mass produce EH216-S and advance commercial operations, said Hu Huazhi, founder and CEO of EHang.
The company will gradually expand production and delivery, bringing safe and reliable autonomous passenger aerial vehicles to the growing market, Hu said.
The Guangzhou Development Zone, in the capital city of Guangdong Province, where Ehang's headquarters is located, has launched the first batch of 10 low-altitude routes for express delivery and the city's first low-altitude medicine-distribution route.
""We are poised to bring more safe, automatic and environment-friendly air-traffic services to people, and promote the development of the low-altitude economy,"" Hu added.

People.cn,"Hongyu, Liang Jun",Economy,20240620,1506,,,Pursuit of emotional value spurs new consumption scenarios,"
Consumers buy products with emotional value at a shopping mall in Beijing. (Photo/Sun Yichun)
Consumer goods have expanded beyond the realm of material possessions and encompass the realm of spirituality. Consumer attitudes have shifted from valuing functionality to seeking enjoyment and therapeutic benefits.
""I ordered a bottle of 'good luck spray' before my final exams and sprayed it on myself and my three roommates before entering the exam room,"" said a university student in Beijing surnamed Zhao.
According to Zhao, people born in the 2000s are particularly fond of ""good luck sprays."" Although they know it's just a regular fabric freshener, spraying it on gives them a sense of good luck and boosts their confidence.
Some people derive emotional value from buying virtual goods. Some people seek companionship and a listening ear online, while others seek solace through offline activities.
Who foots the bill for emotional consumption?
According to a report by McKinsey & Company on China's consumer trends in 2024, 64 percent of consumers prioritize spiritual consumption. This trend is particularly pronounced among younger generations.
Shop owners on Alibaba's e-commerce platform Taobao have noticed that it is mainly young people who are more inclined to invest in products that create emotional value.
Jiang Nan, a Taobao shop owner offering ""wake-up calls for love-struck minds,"" said that the majority of people seeking these services are between the ages of 18 and 28. This particular age group often encounters numerous choices and pressures related to education, career, and relationships.
Why are many young people willing to purchase products that create emotional value?
""I frequently cover the costs of emotional consumption, whether it involves purchasing tangible items like aromatherapy or companionship services,"" said Xiao Bai.
Due to the considerable stress associated with work, Xiao Bai, 32 years old with nine years of work experience, actively seeks a sense of ritual or an avenue for emotional relief through consumption.
""I spent almost 1,000 yuan ($138) to improve my workspace, and it has significantly enhanced my daily work experience,"" said a resident of Shanghai surnamed Liu.
She upgraded her workspace by adding a colorful mechanical keyboard, buying a beautiful pot for her plant, personalizing a desk mat, and displaying her cherished ornaments.
""Being surrounded by items that I like, my mood is elevated every day. Through the power of emotional consumption, I have discovered joy in the little things,"" she said.
Seeking comfort and encouragement also serves as a driving force for young people to make purchases.
A woman surnamed Yang, who hails from east China's Anhui Province and currently lives in Beijing, frequently orders ""tree-hole listening"" services.
""I don't want to be a burden on my family, and I don't have any friends who can empathize with what I'm going through. I need a 'safe space' to vent my negative emotions, and I long for someone to lift my spirits,"" said Yang.
According to a report on China's modern consumption development index in 2023, there has been a significant rise in the number of consumers prioritizing self-satisfaction, reaching 47.8 percent. This marks a growth of 16.8 percent compared to 2022.
This shift reflects the changing consumption preferences of the new generation, who no longer prioritize product functionality alone. They now value the sense of satisfaction and engagement, as well as the ceremonial aspects of consumption.
As living standards improve, Chinese consumers' purchasing power grows rapidly, according to Yi Shaohua, director of the Market Circulation and Consumption Research Office at the National Academy of Economic Strategy, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Consumers are now transitioning from prioritizing the availability to assessing the quality of products or services.
The act of purchasing goods and services has evolved beyond their utilitarian value to include their spiritual value. The added value derived from the pleasure, emotional relief, and other emotional benefits obtained through these purchases have become a significant factor in consumer behavior.
Records show that the domestic perfume and fragrance industry has been growing at an average annual rate of over 20 percent in recent years.
Why do consumers like to buy perfume?
According to figures from data provider iResearch, a survey conducted in 2022 revealed that 74.4 percent of respondents believed that perfume has the power to provide pleasure and emotional healing, ranking it as the top choice among all options.
Furthermore, patent data from Tianyancha, a database query platform, indicates that there are over 3,500 patents related to emotions in the market. This suggests that companies are increasingly prioritizing the exploration of emotional value.

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun",Economy,20240620,1501,,,"Voices on China's financial market reform, opening up at Shanghai Lujiazui Forum","SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The annual Lujiazui Forum, themed ""promoting world economic growth with high-quality financial development,"" runs from Wednesday to Thursday in Shanghai.
On Wednesday, government officials delivered speeches at the forum, pledging to advance China's high-standard financial opening-up and improve the financial sector's support for the real economy, especially new quality productive forces.
Following are the key points of their speeches:
-- Deepening reform of STAR market
China will roll out eight new measures to deepen the reform of its Nasdaq-style Science and Technology Innovation Board (STAR) market, according to China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Wu Qing.
The measures include giving priority to the listing of enterprises making breakthroughs in new industries, new business patterns and new technologies.
""Only by creating a favorable atmosphere that encourages innovation and tolerates failure can we promote the development of new quality productive forces,"" Wu said.
Efforts will also be made to reform the pricing mechanisms for initial public offerings, improve the financing of listed companies on the STAR board, optimize the trading mechanisms, strengthen monitoring, forestall market risks, as well as encourage merger, acquisition and restructuring, Wu said.
-- Keeping monetary policy accommodative
China will continue to keep its monetary policy accommodative as well as strengthen counter-cyclical and inter-temporal adjustments, said Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
The move will help facilitate economic recovery and create a favorable monetary and financial environment for economic and social development.
Pan said the PBOC has adopted a variety of monetary policy instruments, such as cutting the required reserve ratio and policy rates, and bringing down market rates such as the loan prime rates, which created a favorable monetary and financial environment for the high-quality development of the economy.
-- Facilitating foreign investors investing in domestic securities
China will simplify and improve fund management for the dollar-denominated Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor scheme (QFII) and its yuan-denominated sibling, RQFII, said Zhu Hexin, deputy governor of the PBOC.
The QFII and RQFII programs are designed to allow overseas investors to invest in China's domestic capital market.
""We are revising relevant fund management regulations,"" said Zhu, who is also head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
He added that China will also support domestic institutions in making cross-border investments.
-- Promoting insurance sector's development
Accelerating the development of the insurance industry will help improve China's financial market structure, optimize the allocation of financial resources, and enhance the stability of the financial system, said Li Yunze, head of the National Financial Regulatory Administration.
Li implied the sector's growth potentials, saying that China's insurance industry assets only accounted for 7 percent of the country's total financial industry assets, while the international average was around 20 percent.
""As people's demands for elderly and medical care as well as the need to support others in society are constantly increasing, demand for diversified insurance protection is also rapidly rising,"" he said.
With a view to boosting the development of new quality productive forces, Li said the insurance sector should beef up support for strategic emerging industries, advanced manufacturing, new infrastructure and venture capital.
Noting that opening up is an important driving force for the reform and development of China's financial industry, Li said that China sincerely welcomes more foreign institutions and long-term capital to come to China for businesses.

Many foreign enterprises joined this event to captivate Chinese consumers and expand their presence in the huge Chinese market.
During the first four hours of the shopping spree, over 10,000 brands saw their sales skyrocketing more than five times year on year on JD.com, a major Chinese e-commerce platform, with a notable presence of brands from overseas.

During the same period, 1,479 foreign brands saw their transactions double from the previous year on Tmall Global, an e-commerce platform under Alibaba that addresses Chinese consumers' growing demand for international products. ""The platform welcomed 342 new brands during this year's shopping festival, all of which demonstrated impressive performance,"" said an employee of Tmall Global.
Many well-known foreign brands, including those specializing in cosmetics and health supplements, were actively engaging in the shopping festival. For instance, Mistine, a cosmetics brand in Thailand, stocked over 1.9 million products, with 1.2 million items newly imported to China. WHC, a Belgium-based health brand, prepared over 650,000 units of high-purity fish oil, with 10,000 units for its Tmall debut and 160,000 promotional gifts, all flown to bonded warehouses.
""China has introduced policies and measures to boost consumption this year, aiming to revitalize the consumer market and unleash consumption potential,"" said Wei Jigang, deputy director-general of the Center for International Knowledge on Development.
""The '618' shopping festival provides insights into how Chinese consumers' shopping patterns are evolving, based on their shopping carts,"" said Wei.
A prominent shift can be seen in the rising sales of imported products, such as cosmetics, health supplements, and sporting goods, indicating new trends and growth drivers in China's consumer market, along with the country's continuous expansion of imports, Wei explained.
Imported health and nutritional supplements were highly favored by Chinese consumers during this year's shopping festival. According to an executive of Tmall Global, health and beauty brands remain a substantial part of the overseas brands that have entered the Chinese market. Nutritional and anti-aging products are currently the fastest-growing new segment in the health category of the platform. There was also notable growth in premium alcoholic beverages and imported luxury goods.
A ""retro"" trend swept across consumers. According to statistics from Tmall Global, the sales growth of imported digital cameras doubled within the initial 4 hours of the festival. The retro-styled Japanese brand Olympus, in particular, saw an eight-fold increase in transactions.
Besides, there was a remarkable increase of 518 percent in the sales of motorcycle equipment, particularly helmets, and a 248 percent growth in overall transactions of imported CDs and DVDs on the platform.

The sports segment remained a highlight, with hiking, cycling, and water sports gear emerging as three new major trends in outdoor sports consumption.
According to Du Guochen, head of the e-commerce research institute of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a think tank under China's Ministry of Commerce, cross-border e-commerce has experienced rapid growth in recent years. Online sales have continued to grow rapidly in markets like Southeast Asia, Latin America, Central and East Africa, India, and South Korea, said Du.
""Japan, South Korea, and the United States are the main sources of imports for China, from which China buys cosmetics, clothing, headwear and footwear. Southeast Asian countries remain the major destinations of Chinese exports, with a continuous improvement in the types of exported products and constant growth in high-tech product exports,"" Du explained.
To accommodate the growing cross-border e-commerce demand, Chinese platform companies are dedicated to enhancing their transport capacity.
For instance, Cainiao, a world-leading cross-border e-commerce logistics company based in China, updates its parcel volume prediction every day through artificial intelligence (AI) technology. If parcel volumes surged across its core economic zones, the company would promptly launch direct logistics routes, said an executive of Cainiao.
According to statistics, during this year's ""618"" shopping festival, the number of Cainiao's sorting facilities in operation decreased from the usual levels, resulting in cost reductions and improved parcel flow.
Expanding imports is integral for boosting consumption. ""From a global perspective, China's increase in imports provides great opportunities for countries around the world to tap into the Chinese market and promote economic growth,"" said Wei.
""From the Chinese perspective, the imports of high-quality products and services are essential for China's high-quality economic development and for improving people's life quality. Besides, expanding imports can better build China into a trade powerhouse. Moving forward, China will continue to improve its import structure and increase the proportion of imported consumer goods, especially high-end products,"" said Wei.

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun",Economy,20240620,1339,,,China's loan prime rates remain unchanged,"BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's one-year loan prime rate (LPR), a market-based benchmark lending rate, came in at 3.45 percent Thursday, unchanged from the previous month.
The over-five-year LPR, on which many lenders base their mortgage rates, also remained unchanged from the previous reading of 3.95 percent, according to the National Interbank Funding Center.
China cut the over-five-year rate by 25 basis points to 3.95 percent in February, the largest drop in recent years. The one-year rate remained unchanged in February.
The lending rate is expected to be stable in the short term, but there is still room for the rate to dip in the future, according to Wen Bin, chief economist at China Minsheng Bank.
In order to reduce financing costs and maintain the stable net interest margin of banks, deposit rates still need to be further lowered, he said, adding that this leaves space for a subsequent decline of the LPR.
A lower LPR is expected to shore up the credit and property markets, reduce the financial costs of businesses and individuals, and contribute to steady economic recovery.
Monthly LPR data serves as a pricing reference for banks that is based on the rates of the central bank's open market operations, especially the medium-term lending facility rate.

Every day, the port welcomes a steady stream of over 100 colossal container ships, with more than 20,000 heavy-duty trucks thundering across its vast expanses.
According to Wang Bin, a manager with China Ocean Shipping Agency Tianjin Co., Ltd., the cargo and container throughput of the port has been rising steadily.

""We are obviously busier this year than the last,"" said Wang, who has been working at the port for two decades.
Ports are a ""barometer"" of the economy. As a gate to the sea of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in north China, Tianjin Port handled 9.58 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in the first five months of this year, up 5.1 percent year on year, hitting a historical high.
At the crack of dawn, Wang arrived at the Yuanhang International Ore Terminal, the largest ore terminal of Tianjin Port, where the massive bulk carrier ""Cape Asia"" was ready to discharge its mammoth cargo of 171,400 tons of iron ore.
Since November 2023, the terminal has witnessed a dramatic surge in its operations. From February to April this year, the terminal's monthly throughput has maintained double-digit growth compared to the same period last year, reaching a new high in the last five years.
Completing his work at the ore terminal, Wang immediately made his way to the roll-on roll-off terminal, or ro-ro terminal, to handle relevant procedures.
""This year, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of ro-ro vessels, so I have to make more frequent trips to the terminals,"" said Wang.
As a major auto import and export hub in north China, Tianjin Port exactly mirrors the surge in China's automotive exports.
After lunch, Wang rushed back to his office. ""I need to handle the work for the liner service between Tianjin Port and Ethiopia, and coordinate the container operations,"" he explained.

Wang noted that the liner service has seen a notable increase this year, leading to a container shortage caused by the high volume of cargo. As someone who routinely liaises with Ethiopian shipping companies, Wang said this was an unprecedented situation for him.
Tianjin Port maintains trade connections with over 500 ports in more than 180 countries and regions worldwide. It has close ties with ""old friends"" and is also gaining more ""new friends."" On May 6, Tianjin Port launched a direct container shipping route to the east coast of South America. On May 15, a direct route to the east coast of the United States was opened. On May 16, it launched a new direct shipping route to Central America.
""Tianjin Port remains committed to expanding its shipping routes and will never cease its steps of opening up,"" said Liu Yakun, Wang's colleague who is responsible for container shipping businesses. According to Liu, enterprises have been showing a strong demand since the launch of the three new routes.
The port's increasing regional presence has unleashed its potential for transshipment to and from the inland.
At 4:00 p.m., Wang arrived at the Huisheng Terminal. Across the street, heavy-duty trucks loaded with containers were departing the Tianjin Xingang North Container Central Station for destinations as north as Jilin and as west as Xinjiang. Cargoes from 14 provinces were being shipped out from Tianjin Port via sea-rail intermodal transportation.
On the other side, a project to expand the station is currently underway. ""The uptick in foreign trade in specific inland provinces has boosted the need for sea-rail intermodal transportation, creating a highly optimistic market outlook."" said an employee of the station.
As dusk fell, Wang concluded his work at the Huisheng Terminal and made his way to the world's first smart zero-carbon container terminal at Tianjin Port. While the three 200,000-ton berths of the terminal were occupied by massive vessels, not a single staff member was visible. Instead, Level-4 autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) transport robots hauled containers, with operators in the central control room maneuvering levers and buttons based on real-time video feeds to load and unload containers. Several wind turbines were spinning vigorously outside the central control room, supplying electricity to the terminal.

Currently, all container and dry bulk cargo berths at Tianjin Port are covered by shore power, and multiple terminals have achieved self-sufficient green power supply.
""When I started working here, some of the terminals were just dirt lots; 20 years later, the terminals have been increasingly intelligent and clean,"" Wang said.
Tianjin Port has been constantly enhancing its smart port construction with the continuous growth of ships and gradual expansion of the port. This year, the port launched an intelligent container terminal control system with fully autonomous and controllable software and hardware. It has also introduced China's first integrated intelligent system for general cargo with independent intellectual property rights.
Intelligent systems have greatly improved the operational efficiency of the port. For instance, the maximum daily unloading volume of the traditional berths at the Yuanhang International Ore Terminal increased by nearly 90 percent following its transition to automated operations.
Deep into the night, Tianjin Port's terminals were still bustling with activities, marked by increased throughput volumes, a constant flow of vehicles and vessels, and intelligent machinery working tirelessly. The activities of a single day at Tianjin Port vividly showcase the dynamic momentum and robustness of the Chinese economy.

Foreign tourists go through procedures at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport in Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan Province, June 15, 2024. (Xinhua/Dong Xiaohong)
CHENGDU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- On his recent visit to Chengdu, the capital city of southwest China's Sichuan Province, Estonian tourist Sergei Gruzin found himself deeply impressed by the rich culture, gourmet food and the friendliness of the people, vowing to return for another trip in the future.
During his stay, Gruzin visited the giant pandas, savored local noodle dishes and used mobile phone apps to pay for taxis and hotels. ""I found Alipay very convenient for transportation and accommodation,"" he told Xinhua at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport.
Since China introduced a series of favorable visa-free policies last year, the airport has been bustling with foreign travelers, while the number of international tourists visiting Chengdu has also surged, despite its location in the country's southwestern inland region.
As of May this year, China has reached agreements or arrangements to simplify visa procedures with over 40 countries and achieved comprehensive mutual visa exemption with more than 20 countries.
Official data shows that, the number of foreigners visiting China in the first quarter of this year increased more than threefold compared to the same period last year. A total of 466,000 visas were issued to foreigners, up 118.8 percent year-on-year. Additionally, nearly 1.99 million foreigners entered China visa-free, a year-on-year increase of 266.1 percent.
In the latest update to its visa policies, China has announced that New Zealand and Australia will be included in its list of unilateral visa-free countries. This means that New Zealand and Australian passport holders will be able to enter China without a visa for business, tourism, visiting relatives and friends, and transit, for up to 15 days.
Zheng Jun, general manager of Sichuan Comfort International Travel Service Co., Ltd., said that as of June 10, the company had received 7,864 inbound visitors this year, a 289.69 percent increase on the same period in 2023.
""The number of tourists from visa-free countries or those eligible for group landing visas has significantly increased. This includes visitors from countries such as France, Germany, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and the Republic of Korea,"" Zheng explained.
Boasting rich and unique tourism resources, Sichuan is home to giant pandas, stunning natural landscapes, a long and storied history, and vibrant ethnic customs. These attributes make it a renowned destination for tourists both in China and abroad. To ensure utmost convenience for international visitors, the province has enhanced its airports, scenic spots, and other facilities with a range of services.
Cui Lei, deputy manager of the terminal management center at the airport, said that customs and security inspection procedures have been streamlined for foreign tourists.
Online platforms now provide 24-hour services for SIM cards, currency exchange, ATM withdrawals and mobile payments, according to Lin Ning, an airport official.
Additionally, all shops within the terminals support various payment methods, including cash, bank cards and mobile payments, ensuring that foreign visitors can make purchases without any hassle from the moment they arrive in Sichuan, Lin added.
At the Kuanzhai Alley, an iconic tourist attraction and historic neighborhood in Chengdu, and the Chengdu Jinsha Site Museum, another popular tourist spot, the availability of convenient and diverse payment methods has greatly improved the consumption experience for foreign tourists.
The museum's visitor service center, relic hall, exhibition hall and online service platform provide multilingual guide services.
""Implementing visa-free policies is an important step in promoting openness and exchange,"" said Liu Jun, a professor at the tourism school of Sichuan University.
""In addition to providing various convenient services, Chinese tourist cities like Chengdu need to resume and strengthen overseas tourism marketing. This includes introducing foreign tourists to new consumption scenes, emerging business models and new products that have emerged in recent years,"" Lin added.

An employee arranges orders placed during this year's June 18 shopping carnival at a food company in Jinhua, Zhejiang province, on June 15. YANG MEIQING/FOR CHINA DAILY
The enthusiasm of Chinese consumers has been evident during this year's June 18 shopping carnival, as major e-commerce platforms ramped up efforts to provide steep discounts and shopping subsidies as well as simplify promotional methods to attract price-conscious shoppers and bolster sales.
Industry experts said the midyear promotional campaign has played a vital role in stimulating people's purchasing appetites, promoting the recovery of consumption and shoring up the economy, with electronic devices containing innovative technologies and domestic brands proving popular among consumers.
As Chinese shoppers have become more rational about potential purchases, online retailers have adopted a more pragmatic and simpler approach by canceling presale campaigns this year, with a key focus on cost-effective products and the use of livestreaming to further unleash the immense potential of consumption, they added.
Data from e-commerce giant JD, which initiated the midyear promotional event, showed that more than 10,000 brands saw their sales surge over fivefold in the first four hours of the June 18 shopping carnival, which kicked off at 8 pm on May 31.
Sales of AI-powered computers, smartphones and learning devices via JD's online marketplaces soared 260 percent year-on-year in the first hour of the promotional gala, while the transaction volume of foldable screen phones, smartwatches and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, skyrocketed over 100 percent year-on-year in short bursts of time, JD said.
The turnover of new products from more than 700 home appliance brands increased over 100 percent year-on-year in the first four hours, JD said. More than 2,500 clothing brands and 300 beauty brands witnessed their sales grow over 100 percent compared with the same period last year.
In addition, the number of viewers of JD's promotional livestreaming sessions skyrocketed 460 percent year-on-year with orders from sessions hosted by JD's professional procurement and sales teams up 300 percent compared with last year's Singles' Day shopping festival.
The company has launched a subsidy campaign worth 10 billion yuan ($1.38 billion) during the June 18 shopping spree, offering a variety of low-priced products.
Data from Tmall, Alibaba's business-to-customer platform, showed that sales of 59 brands surpassed 100 million yuan within the first four hours of its midyear promotional event, which started at 8 pm on May 20.
Turnover of Apple's products on Tmall exceeded 1.5 billion yuan within the first hour, while sales of domestic smartphone brands such as Huawei, Xiaomi and Vivo surpassed 100 million yuan during the period, Tmall said.
Moreover, the transaction volume of 11 cosmetics and skin care brands as well as 23 household appliance brands — including Haier, Hisense and Xiaomi — crossed the 100 million yuan threshold in the first four hours. Sales of luxury brands, such as Valentino and Miu Miu, exceeded that of the entire day last year within the first hour of the gala, it added.
Outdoor sporting goods, consumer electronic products, nutrition and healthcare items and household appliances witnessed robust growth during the shopping extravaganza that now spans about one month.
Jason Yu, general manager of Kantar Worldpanel China, a market research provider, said, ""Price is a very basic and core competitiveness for e-commerce platforms as consumers could purchase premium products with high cost-effectiveness during the promotional event, which will satisfy their demand for consumption upgrade.""
Yu said some brands are paying more attention to improving consumer experience, as well as providing various discounts and membership services, striking a balance between chasing commercial interests and optimizing user experience.

It is noteworthy that an increasing number of brands are moving toward starting their own normalized livestreaming sessions, reducing over-dependence on top livestreamers and nurturing new anchors, Yu said.
Furthermore, he added that domestic brands have stepped up investments in technological innovation, research and development while improving the quality of products to cater to demand from value-conscious consumers.
""Consumption has become the main driving force boosting China's economic growth, and the June 18 shopping festival is pivotal to unleashing consumers' purchasing potential and promoting the recovery of the economy,"" said Wang Yun, a researcher at the Academy of Macroeconomic Research, which is affiliated with the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic regulator.
Wang said that domestic brands are increasingly gaining popularity among Chinese consumers, especially the post-90s and post-00s generations, who have a growing sense of national pride and confidence in Chinese culture.
China's consumer market has witnessed a sustained recovery. Retail sales, a significant indicator of consumption strength, grew 4.1 percent year-on-year in the first five months, said the National Bureau of Statistics. Online retail sales jumped 12.4 percent year-on-year during the January-May period.
The country has rolled out a raft of measures to spur the consumption of products and services such as automobiles, electronics, housing and home decor amid its broader push to boost momentum and stabilize the economy.
More efforts should be made to stabilize and expand employment, improve household incomes, boost people's ability and willingness to spend and propel the country's economic growth, said Pan Helin, a member of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's Expert Committee for Information and Communication Economy.
Industry insiders said chasing high gross merchandise volume, or GMV, is no longer the focus of the June 18 shopping carnival, while consumers are increasingly looking for cost-effective local alternatives as Chinese brands' product quality and safety improve.
They added that Chinese consumer enthusiasm for the online shopping festival will not wane, but what e-commerce platforms should do is to improve supply chains, and optimize business and operational models in accordance with shoppers' buying habits and preferences.
Mo Daiqing, a senior analyst at the Internet Economy Institute, a domestic consultancy, said it is of great significance for e-commerce platforms to adopt low-price strategies and offer cost-effective commodities, so as to attract a new breed of users and rev up sales.
Noting that Chinese consumers are more rational now and carefully review their needs, with an emphasis on quality and product value, Mo said online retailers have made promotional methods simpler this time, with direct price cuts being a preferred strategy, which is conducive to improving user loyalty and repurchase rates.
Moreover, both JD and Tmall are facing intensified competition from video-sharing and livestreaming platforms, including Douyin and Kuaishou, which are betting big on e-commerce in livestreaming formats, Mo added.
""Major Chinese e-commerce platforms have canceled presales for this year's June 18 shopping extravaganza, simplifying the online shopping process and optimizing consumer shopping experiences and services,"" said Dong Puyu, a researcher at CIO Manage, a Beijing-based digital economy market consultancy.
Dong said simplified promotional events and direct price cuts will help promote the healthy development of e-commerce and better protect the rights and interests of consumers over the long term.
However, the move may lead to intensified competition among e-commerce players and merchants need to adopt new sales strategies and adjust their inventory management models, he added.
Zhao Ping, deputy head of the Beijing-based Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said China's consumer market is expected to see a recovery of growth this year. He called for efforts to further cut taxes and fees for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, expand employment and increase household disposable incomes to further perk up consumption.

The measures include giving priority to the listing of enterprises making breakthroughs in new industries, new business patterns and new technologies, according to the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
Considering that enterprises with new quality productive forces often demand high investment and long growth cycles, and come with development uncertainties, the CSRC pledged to improve institutional inclusiveness and encourage high-quality tech firms that are yet to make profits to list on the STAR market.
Speaking about the new measures at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai on Wednesday, CSRC Chairman Wu Qing, said, ""Only by creating a favorable atmosphere that encourages innovation and tolerates failure can we promote the development of new quality productive forces.""
Efforts will also be made to reform the pricing mechanisms for initial public offerings (IPOs), improve the financing of listed companies on the STAR board, optimize the trading mechanisms, strengthen monitoring, forestal market risks, as well as encourage merger, acquisition and restructuring, according to the CSRC.
In the next stage, the commission will work to introduce more instruments, products and services of the capital market to meet the demand of enterprises with new quality productive forces, Wu told the forum.
He said the CSRC will work with relevant parties to create favorable conditions to attract more medium and long-term funds into the capital market and optimize support policies throughout the entire investment and financing cycle.
Since its launch in 2019, the STAR market has become the preferred listing destination for ""hard-tech"" companies, with its magnetic appeal continuing to grow.

BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- As you sip a cup of tea, particularly tea from east China's Fujian Province, two remote sensing satellites in orbit are monitoring the tea planting and maintenance.
The two satellites, both launched in 2022, can obtain the images with a resolution higher than 0.5 meters and a width of 15 km. They serve the tea-producing area in Anxi County, Fujian Province, which is famous for its tea industry.
The output value of the province's whole tea industry chain exceeded 150 billion yuan (about 21.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 2022, while its tea exports exceeded 3.5 billion yuan. Both ranked first in the country.
With the tea plantation area of 3.61 million mu (about 240,667 hectares), the province received 520,000 tonnes of raw tea output in 2022.
REMOTE SENSING DIGITALIZING TEA INDUSTRY
In order to drive the intelligent progress of tea production, the province applied remote sensing to provide accurate data analysis and services for tea planting, processing and sales.
Using remote sensing images, technicians combined the information such as meteorology, soil, agriculture and hydrology to digitally extract more than 40 indexes including area, elevation, slope, accumulated temperature, illumination, precipitation, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium of tea gardens and build a digital database, said Wei Leichen, vice-general manager of Satellite Link Bridge, one of developers of the two satellites.
According to the spectral analysis of the image data, the technicians obtained the index data of soil moisture and organic matter content from the tea garden and tea farmers have been recommended soil testing formulas and fertilization guidelines suitable for tea plots based on the abundance of soil nutrient elements and different climatic conditions, as well as tea tree varieties and tree ages.
Satellite remote sensing is capable of monitoring a large area obtaining key information, crucial for tea farmers, such as the growth of tea gardens, disease and insect pests, as well as soil moisture and nutrients in real time.
Conversely, the collection of remote sensing data also requires tea farmers to provide relevant data such as the fertilization of tea gardens. Such interactions pushed the monitoring more efficiently and comprehensive, according to Wei.
In addition to the tea industry, the remote sensing data of the two satellites has now been applied in more fields such as agriculture, forestry, land, meteorology and environmental protection in Fujian Province.
Remote sensing technology improves the yield and quality of crops, reduces the production cost and realizes the sustainable development of agriculture, as well as playing an important role in reducing carbon emissions, said Wei.
ECO-FRIENDLY TEA INDUSTRY
""The emissions of the tea industry mainly come from tea gardens, especially excessive nitrogen fertilizer and soil acidification, product processing, distribution, and consumption,"" said Gao Shuilian, associate professor of the Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University.
The province has implemented precise fertilization and improved fertilization methods on its tea fields.
Liao Hong, an agronomist at Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, began to promote eco-friendly tea farms under the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian in 2018. Her team found the perennial planting of tea trees consumed excessive soil nutrients and caused soil degradation.
To improve the quality of both soil and tea, they proposed the eco-friendly approach featuring interplanting tea with soybeans in summer and rapeseed in winter.
Phosphorus and potassium, released from the soil during the cultivation of rapeseed, return to the field after flowering and it improves the soil fertility. After the spring tea is collected, soybean is interplanted between the plots then and took effect as biological nitrogen fixing to conduct green fertilization.
Besides, Anxi County has built a carbon footprint monitoring system of Tieguanyin, the best oolong tea variety produced there, Lin Liyan, head of its local science and technology bureau, was quoted by the Science and Technology Daily as saying, adding that the green development mode with low energy consumption, low pollution and low emissions has taken shape of the county's tea industry.
Lan Siren, president of the Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, suggested deepening the integration of big data, photoelectric information, digital economy and tea industry and beefing up its green development.

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Wu Chaolan",Economy,20240620,856,,,China to expand opening-up of VC investment,"BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China will expand the opening up of venture capital (VC) investment by revising regulations and boosting accessibility for foreign investors, according to a raft of measures unveiled by the State Council, as the country aims to develop patient capital.
The country will revise the regulations on the administration of foreign-invested VC enterprises to facilitate foreign investors in engaging in VC within the territory.
Support will be provided to international professional investment institutions and teams to establish renminbi funds within the territory, and leverage their investment experience and comprehensive service advantages.
Developing VC is a key step to promoting the virtuous cycle of technology, industry and finance, per the guidelines issued by the State Council General Office.
Encouraging long-term capital to flow into VC investment is essential to fostering innovation, industrial growth and financial stability. To this end, China will support insurance institutions in investing in VC funds based on market principles.
Efforts will be made to deepen pilot projects facilitating cross-border financing, and to optimize foreign exchange management under foreign direct investment (FDI) further, making it easier for VC institutions and other business entities to handle foreign exchange transactions.
China also aims to expand the scope of its pilot mechanism for Qualified Foreign Limited Partnerships (QFLP), and guide foreign VC institutions to conduct cross-border investment in a regulated manner.
Additionally, efforts will be made to promote and regulate the overseas investment of Chinese VC institutions.
At a high-level meeting in April, China's policymakers highlighted the need to develop patient capital, a term that is rarely used at such meetings and describes long-term investment eyeing sustainable growth.
Efforts will be made to bolster new, quality productive forces and emerging industries while actively developing VC and patient capital, according to a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on April 30.
During a State Council executive meeting in early June, China studied policy measures to boost the high-quality development of VC investment.
""The venture capital industry is transitioning from its previous rapid development phase to a new phase of reshuffling, reconstruction and adjustment,"" said Lin Haojun, chairman of the Guangdong Technology Financial Group, one of China's earliest VC institutions.
To fully leverage the crucial role of VC in supporting technological innovation, China will guide VC to stabilize and increase investment in key areas, and promote the growth of technology-based companies to provide strong support for the realization of high-level technological self-reliance, among other innovation prowess goals, according to the new measures.
For technology-based enterprises that achieve breakthroughs in critical core technologies, the country will establish green channels for financing through listings, bond issuance, and mergers and acquisitions. This will also improve the efficiency and quality of issuance reviews within the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the Beijing Stock Exchange.
To prevent improper policy measures that could negatively impact VC, a consultation mechanism for major policies will be established. Before introducing significant policies related to the VC industry and its institutions, relevant government departments must conduct consistency evaluations of macro policy orientations as required.
Last year, China's VC and private equity markets saw a total of 8,322 new funds established, with the subscribed scale of new funds reaching 614.06 billion U.S. dollars, according to a report issued by an institute under ChinaVenture.

BRUSSELS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The China Economic Information Service of Xinhua News Agency and the China Chamber of Commerce to the European Union on Wednesday jointly launched a report focusing on Chinese new energy vehicle (NEV) manufacturers in Europe.
The report titled ""Greening Europe -- Report on the Development of Chinese NEV Manufacturers in Europe"" was launched alongside the Europe-China CEO Roundtable Panel held in Brussels.
Addressing the event, President of Xinhua News Agency Fu Hua said China and Europe are fully capable of achieving mutual benefits and win-win cooperation in the new energy vehicle (NEV) sector, given their commitment to promoting energy conservation, reduction of carbon emissions and harmonious coexistence between man and nature.
As China's national news agency, a global news agency and a high-end think tank, Xinhua News Agency has produced a series of widely-followed news reports and think tank reports on the development of China's NEV industry and China-Europe cooperation in the NEV sector, Fu said.
The report released on Wednesday has analyzed the global demand for NEVs and summarized the development and competitive advantages of China's NEV industry, offering valuable references for China and Europe to strengthen technology cooperation, policy exchanges, supply chain collaboration and investment, he said.

Calling China's leadership in decarbonization industries ""a path to follow,"" former Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations Brice Lalonde said China has accumulated productivity gains in the NEV sector and covered all stages necessary in this industry.
""We must seek to collaborate with China,"" noted Lalonde, who is also president of EdEn, an association of companies committed to decarbonization in France and Europe. ""The last thing we need is a trade war ... Engaging in bilateral discussions to address the complexity of issues is preferable,"" he stressed.
During the roundtable panel, participants agreed that China and Europe have a broad foundation for cooperation in developing NEVs and achieving carbon neutrality.
Calling on China and Europe to maintain open and cooperative relations, they noted that imposing protective tariffs will ultimately harm European car manufacturers and consumers and negatively impact the European economy.

Signal for opening-up

Regarding the Shanghai center, the IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said: ""The center will further strengthen the IMF's engagement in the dynamic Asia Pacific region, deepen our understanding of perspectives from member countries, and foster international economic cooperation.""
The CSRC recently approved BNP Paribas (China) to act as a custodian for securities investment funds, and also approved HSBC Qianhai Securities to engage in margin trading. During the forum, Chinese financial authorities underscored efforts to further open up China's financial market and welcome foreign investments to operate in the country.

The signals from the forum clearly demonstrate that China's financial reform and opening-up are making significant progress, with regulatory authorities actively driving this process forward. This will boost the confidence of both domestic and foreign markets and investors in the growth of China's financial sector, Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
These proactive measures will elevate China's financial status, fostering closer and mutually beneficial connections between the global financial system and the Chinese market, and not only contribute to the enhancement of China's financial system, but also promote the healthy development of the global financial and monetary systems, professor Xi said.
Data shows that in 2023, the value added of Shanghai's financial industry reached 864.686 billion yuan ($119.15 billion), an increase of 5.2 percent year-on-year. In the first quarter of this year, the value added of Shanghai's financial industry reached 209.67 billion yuan, an increase of 5.1 percent year-on-year.
Attractiveness of Chinese market
The Lujiazui Forum has attracted a number of guests from overseas financial regulatory agencies and institutions.
Andrew S Komaroff, Chief Operating Officer of Neuberger Berman Group, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the Lujiazui Forum sends a strong signal that China is committed to driving high-quality growth and playing a constructive role in addressing global economic challenges.
""China's pursuit of high-quality development, characterized by a focus on sustainability, innovation, and inclusive growth, is crucial for the global economy. As the world's second-largest economy, China's continued openness and integration into the global financial system will be critical in fostering greater international cooperation and stability. China's commitment to further liberalizing its financial markets and promoting two-way capital flows aligns well with the interests of global investors like Neuberger Berman,"" Komaroff said.
China's large and rapidly evolving economy, coupled with its ongoing financial reforms and opening-up, presents a wealth of investment opportunities for global asset managers. The country's emphasis on innovation, particularly in sectors such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy, makes it an attractive destination for long-term, high-quality investments. Additionally, China's efforts to strengthen corporate governance and investor protection standards further enhance its appeal as an investment destination, Komaroff said.

In my visits around China over the last 18 months, I can see that the opening-up process is actually happening, particularly in areas such as green finance, cross-border investment and digital finance,"" McLean said.
The City of London is the global financial center with specific strengths including asset management, pensions, insurance, green finance and financial and professional services which all provide substantial areas for further cooperation and collaboration with China, McLean added.

People.cn,"Wu Chaolan, Liang Jun",Economy,20240619,1522,,,China takes firm steps to prevent exchange rate overshooting: central bank governor,"SHANGHAI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China has taken firm steps to prevent the risks of exchange rate overshooting, said Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People's Bank of China, on Wednesday.
The RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable in complicated circumstances, Pan said at the 15th Lujiazui Forum held in Shanghai.
Entering this year, the major advanced economies have postponed, yet again, their monetary policy reversal timing and the China-U.S. interest rate spread has continued to be relatively high, he added.
Letting the market play a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates, China's central bank has maintained the flexibility of the exchange rate, while strengthening guidance of expectations and taking firm steps to prevent the risks of exchange rate overshooting, Pan said.
Through sustained efforts over the years, China's foreign exchange market has achieved substantial progress, with market participants becoming more mature and transacting in a more rational manner, he noted.
An increasing number of business entities are using the tools for exchange rate risk hedging, Pan said, adding that as the RMB cross-border receipts and payments now account for 30 percent of trade in goods, the exposure of enterprises to currency exchange risks has been reduced.
Pan said China is also more experienced in coping with foreign exchange market fluctuations.
As major economies are gradually reversing their monetary policies this year and the dollar appreciation is weakening, the difference between the monetary policy cycles at home and abroad is narrowing, he said.
These factors combined will help keep the RMB exchange rate basically stable and balance cross-border capital flows, thereby gaining more space for China's monetary policy maneuvers, Pan said.

People.cn,"Wu Chaolan, Liang Jun",Economy,20240619,1502,,,China ups efforts to build Shanghai into strong international financial center,"BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China has intensified moves to develop its Shanghai Municipality into a ""strong international financial center"" as part of the efforts to build up financial strength and promote high-level opening up.
The research bureau of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, unveiled a string of measures to improve Shanghai's competitiveness and influence in a statement on Tuesday.
The central bank will formulate action plans for Shanghai to facilitate cross-border financial services and enhance financial support for the headquarters economy, the statement said.
The city is encouraged to become a green financial hub, with efforts to promote the renminbi as a pricing currency for green energy. Its communication with other international financial organizations and centers will be strengthened to optimize business environment and attract more foreign institutions and long-term capital.
The new measures came as China moved to build itself into a financial powerhouse to pursue high-quality development of the financial sector.
The central financial work conference held last October called for accelerating the building of a nation with a strong financial sector. The goal was detailed at a key meeting attended by senior officials in January this year, with a series of core elements, including strong international financial centers.
The PBOC statement stressed the necessity of international financial centers to a nation that aims to develop a strong financial sector.
""The process of promoting the construction of Shanghai as an international financial center is the process of the country's continuous efforts to expand opening up,"" the statement said.
As one of the most internationalized cities in China, Shanghai plays a crucial role in the country's financial opening up.
The city boasts a diverse array of financial markets including stocks, bonds and currencies and provides a wide range of services from custody to settlement and clearing.
By the end of 2023, there were 548 foreign-funded institutions operating in Shanghai, accounting for over 30 percent of the total financial institutions there, and nearly 500,000 people were employed in the financial sector.
As an important hub for the renminbi's internationalization, Shanghai's cross-border renminbi receipts and payments amounted to 23 trillion yuan (3.23 trillion U.S. dollars) last year, accounting for nearly 44 percent of the country's total.
At present, the renminbi has emerged as the fourth most active currency in global payment, the third in trade financing and the fifth in transactions.
The central bank will improve the connectivity of financial markets at home and abroad, strengthen international standard governance and cooperation in financial infrastructure, and improve the legal and institutional construction of financial infrastructure, according to the statement.
Work will be done to establish a financial regulatory system commensurate with the level of financial openness, with enhanced digitalization of regulation and continuous monitoring of cross-border capital flows in key areas, industries, and businesses, the statement added.

People.cn,"Wu Chaolan, Liang Jun",Economy,20240619,1403,,,China to keep monetary policy accommodative: central bank governor,"SHANGHAI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to keep its monetary policy accommodative as well as strengthen counter-cyclical and inter-temporal adjustments, the central bank governor said Wednesday.
The move will help facilitate economic recovery and create a favorable monetary and financial environment for economic and social development, said Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), at the 15th Lujiazui Forum held in Shanghai.
Looking ahead, while undergoing continued recovery, the Chinese economy is still confronted with some challenges, as the effective demand is still insufficient; there are blockages to domestic economic circulation, and the complexity, severity, and uncertainty of the external environment have risen significantly, he said.
Since the beginning of this year, the global inflation has started to cool down, but it is still strongly sticky, Pan said, adding that some central banks such as the European Central Bank have begun their rate cuts while some others are still observing the developments and may cut rates later this year.
On the whole, central banks remain unchanged with their high interest rates and restrictive monetary policy stance, while China differs somewhat from them, Pan said. ""Our monetary policy stance is accommodative, providing financial support for the continuous economic recovery.""
Pan said the PBOC has adopted a variety of monetary policy instruments, such as cutting the required reserve ratio and policy rates, and bringing down market rates such as the loan prime rates, which created a favorable monetary and financial environment for the high-quality development of the economy.
At May-end, the year-on-year growth rate of the aggregate financing to the real economy and M2 reached 8.4 percent and 7 percent, respectively, both higher than the nominal GDP growth rate in the first quarter of this year. The interest rate on new loans issued in May stood at a relatively low level of 3.67 percent.
Concerning the structure of money and credit, the PBOC gave full play to the role of macro-prudential policies and structural monetary policy instruments, Pan said.
""We have initiated the central bank lending for sci-tech innovation and technological transformation, which aims to enhance financial support for sci-tech innovation and equipment upgrading and renovation. We have launched a package of policies to support the real estate sector, including lowering the minimum down payment ratios for individual's commercial housing mortgages,"" Pan said.
Currently, China's outstanding balance of structural monetary policy instruments were valued at around 7 trillion yuan (983.7 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for about 15 percent of the balance sheet of the PBOC, Pan said, adding that the instruments were set to support key areas and weak links of the national economy, such as the development of micro and small businesses and green transformation.
The PBOC also seeks to regulate market behaviors, make better use of existing inefficient financial resources and enhance the efficiency of fund use, Pan said.

NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- At the Nigerian Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center near Abuja, the capital of the West African country, Chinese agricultural experts have a daily routine of examining newly harvested rice.
As a result of years of dedicated work, experts from the Chinese company Green Agriculture West Africa Ltd. (GAWAL) have developed a high-yield rice seed tailored to local conditions, which outperforms native varieties by over 20 percent. This seed, endorsed by Nigerian agricultural authorities, is now planted across two-thirds of the country's states.
Lawal Musa, a farmer from Jigawa State, has been growing this rice for several years. ""Rice is vital in Nigeria and every family consumes it. With China's cooperation, Nigeria is on the path to achieving food self-sufficiency,"" he said, praising the rice for its high productivity and ability to withstand diseases and drought.
GAWAL, a leading seed company in Nigeria, contributed to the government's seed supply program by distributing over 30,000 tons of seeds across more than 30 states. Its effort has significantly boosted the country's rice production by more than 2 million tons.

TRANSFERRING TECHNIQUES TO LOCAL FARMERS
Over the past decade, the Nigerian Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center has stood out among the 24 centers established by China across Africa. These centers are pivotal in advancing agricultural technology, successfully transferring over 300 sophisticated agricultural techniques to local farmers.
The impact of these initiatives is substantial, boosting crop yields by 30 percent and positively affecting over 1 million smallholder farmers throughout Africa.
With concerted efforts, Chinese agricultural specialists have remarkably improved the yield and quality of staple crops such as rice, cassava and soybeans. Moreover, they have introduced an array of new fruit, vegetable, and bean varieties. These contributions have not only enriched the diversity of African diets but also forged fresh pathways for the region's agricultural progress.
In Kigali, Rwanda, Leonidas Mushimiyimana operates the region's largest mushroom cultivation workshop, producing up to 30,000 mushroom tubes monthly and 600 kilograms of fresh mushrooms weekly.
Juncao is a hybrid grass and an important multifunctional agricultural resource developed and used for mushroom farming in China.
After learning the Juncao cultivation technology, Mushimiyimana established the workshop, employing dozens of people. He plans to expand his business to produce dried mushroom products for international markets, fostering communal prosperity.
Juncao technology now benefits over 4,000 Rwandan farmers, creating more than 30,000 jobs along the agricultural value chain.

ENHANCING VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS
China-Africa agricultural cooperation extends beyond the fields, encompassing the entire industrial chain to enhance the processing capacity and added value of African agricultural products, thereby increasing farmers' incomes.

Despite its favorable natural conditions as Africa's largest natural rubber producer, Cote d'Ivoire's lack of processing capacity limited its exports in the past.
Yobouet Roland, a local cooperative member, noted that Chinese factories have doubled their production by providing new sales channels.
Brou Bonaventure, from the Ivorian Interprofessional Fund for Agricultural Research and Advice, said the Chinese factory has boosted local processing capacity and provided fair, stable shipping channels, facilitating farmers to expand their rubber production.
""The Chinese factory has increased the value of our rubber products. We are grateful to China!"" Bonaventure exclaimed.
Cassava, a crucial food crop in Africa, has also seen advancements. Poor varieties and technical limitations hindered yield and processing previously.
During a training session by the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (CATAS), agricultural officials from South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda, and the Republic of the Congo were amazed to learn cassava starch could be processed into products like cookies, yogurt, cakes and noodles.
In Nigeria, GAWAL and CATAS have jointly established a modern agricultural demonstration base in Abuja, featuring a small-scale cassava starch processing line and a 10-acre high-yield demonstration base. Local training in cassava cultivation and processing has been held there.
Wang Yun, GAWAL's general manager, said that the base will continue training in cassava seedling cultivation, planting and processing to extend the entire cassava industry chain.

Kenya, a major global exporter of fresh flowers, used to face challenges in accessing new markets due to high tariffs and complex regulations.
However, China's ""green channel"" for African agricultural products has expedited inspection and quarantine processes and expanded tariff exemptions, benefiting Kenya's flower industry and other African agricultural products like avocado, citrus, pineapple and coffee.
Huang Zinan, chairwoman of Hunan Xiyue Culture Media Co., Ltd., said her company, which cooperates with seven Kenyan flower farms including Tambuzi, sells 100,000 flowers monthly across 14 Chinese cities and exports to Russia and Australia.
Huang noted the significant demand of the Chinese market for high-end and rare flower varieties. She envisioned developing derivative products such as essence oils and floral water to enhance the market competitiveness of Kenyan flowers, boosting local employment and increasing flower farmers' incomes.
As of June 2023, 16 agricultural products from 11 African countries have accessed China through the ""green channel,"" with more African specialty commodities entering the Chinese market.
China's trade promotion measures have rapidly increased Africa's agricultural exports to China, making China Africa's second-largest agricultural export destination.

""It's not enough for Boeing to shrug its shoulders and say, well, mistakes happen,"" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, chair of a Senate subcommittee on investigations, said in his opening remarks.
""This is not an industry where it's okay to cut corners, to reduce inspections, to take shortcuts, and rely on broken parts that happen to be sitting around,"" Blumenthal said.
Among the audience are families of victims of the two crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, involving Boeing's 737 Max. Many came holding posters of loved ones who lost their lives in those tragedies.
Blumenthal also mentioned the incident in January when a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 shortly after takeoff. ""The facade quite literally blew off the hollow shell that had been Boeing's promises to the world,"" he said.
Calhoun, who took charge in January 2020 following the two deadly crashes, defended the company's actions to try to improve manufacturing quality and restore its damaged safety reputation in recent years.
Senators also questioned the Boeing CEO over the company's treatment of whistleblowers.
Republican Senator Ron Johnson, ranking member of the subcommittee, said in the hearing that after whistleblower John Barnett raised his concerns about missing parts, ""he reported that his supervisor called him 19 times in one day, and 21 times another day.""
""When Barnett asked his supervisor about those calls, he was told, 'I'm going to push you until you break',"" Johnson said.
Barnett, who testified in his whistleblower case against the troubled plane-maker, was found dead from a gunshot wound in his car in Charleston, South Carolina on March 9. A law enforcement investigation has concluded that the cause of death was suicide.
""Do you think Boeing has done enough today to make those kinds of corrections and what would you say to the whistleblowers who have come forward and face retaliation?"" Johnson said.
""I asked myself that question every day. Have we done enough? ""Calhoun said.
Republican Senator Josh Hawley criticized the Boeing CEO's compensation package of nearly 32.8 million last year, noting that it's a 45-percent increase from 2022.
""We've had multiple whistleblowers come before this committee and allege that Boeing is cutting every possible corner on quality and safety not just in the past, but now,"" said Hawley.
""They've alleged that you've eliminated safety inspections that there are fewer inspectors doing quality inspections out there. They alleged that when they raised quality issues and concerns, they were reassigned, they were retaliated against, they were physically threatened,"" Hawley continued.
In his response, Calhoun said the company has increased quality inspectors ""significantly.""
Calling on Boeing to change ""a broken safety culture,"" Blumenthal said the plane-maker ""needs to stop thinking about the next earnings call and start thinking about the next generation.""

People.cn,"Wu Chaolan, Liang Jun",Economy,20240619,854,,,"Interview: ""We are constantly looking for more opportunities in China,"" Deutsche Bank China COO says","SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Deutsche Bank has recently made substantial investments in enhancing its operational capacity in north China's Tianjin Municipality, Ole Gerdau, chief operating officer at Deutsche Bank China, told Xinhua in an interview on Monday.
Deutsche Bank has a storied history marked by the establishment of its first international branch in Shanghai. Today, it is an international industry leader recognized as a preeminent financial institution among foreign banks in China, boasting an extensive array of licenses and a commitment to delivering financial services to a diverse clientele, including multinational corporations and financial entities.
Gerdau underscored the pivotal role of China's economic liberalization and the RMB's global ascendancy as cornerstones of Deutsche Bank's strategic vision in China. ""We are dedicated to our clients' lasting success and financial security at home and abroad. And for many of our large multinational clients, China is the most important overseas market,"" he said.
Testament to its deep dedication to China, the bank has embarked on a robust investment trajectory aimed at bolstering its operational and technological capabilities to better cater to its local clients. It has notably expanded its footprint in Tianjin and brought on board five senior sector analysts to delve into greater China's key growth sectors, including the renewables and utilities, consumer discretionary, and automation and industrial sectors.
Deutsche Bank is positive about China's economic growth, elevating its GDP growth projection for 2024 by half a percentage point in April, with the revised figure at 5.2 percent. This anticipated growth is set to be propelled by a resurgence in exports and the intensification of fiscal spending.
Gerdau believes that, despite the Chinese economy's growth rate moving away from double-digit figures, its large size ensures it will continue to contribute significantly to global economic growth.
He also noted that China's emergence as an innovative economy has been nothing short of remarkable, particularly in sectors such as electric vehicles, electronic payments and e-commerce, where it offers an unparalleled consumer experience. Deutsche Bank is eager to forge cooperation with indigenous fintech firms, fostering a symbiotic relationship of learning and growth, he said.
The gradual opening of China's market has created numerous possibilities for the bank. ""Whenever there was another step of opening, there were lots of opportunities coming out of it. We are constantly looking for more opportunities,"" he said, highlighting the bank's key role of supporting large Chinese corporations and institutional Chinese investors in achieving their international aspirations.

Despite a decline of 15.7 percent to 31,500 units due to weak German domestic demand, China remained the most important supplier of all-electric cars to Europe's largest economy. In the same period last year, the share was still around 30 percent.
Germany's total imports of all-electric vehicles fell by 45.3 percent in the months to April, according to the figures. Imports from countries such as the Czech Republic and South Korea saw particularly sharp declines.
Despite clear warnings from industry, the European Union (EU) recently announced higher tariffs on electric cars from China. From July, import taxes are expected to be raised to up to 38.1 percent, which would affect all car manufacturers in China, including German companies producing there.
""This measure further increases the risk of a global trade conflict,"" said Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), emphasizing the industry's commitment to free and fair trade.
The so-called ""countervailing duties"" on electric cars imported from China were ""not suitable for strengthening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry,"" Mueller added. ""The fact is that we need China to solve global problems.""
China remains Germany's most important sales market for cars, as one in three exported cars still went there in the first quarter, according to consulting firm Ernst and Young (EY).

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun",Economy,20240618,1647,,,Chinese coal hub emerges as hydrogen energy pioneer,"TAIYUAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Xiaoyi, a prominent coal hub in northern China, is evolving into a hydrogen energy pioneer as the resource-depleted city seeks new growth engines.
In late May, three hydrogen-powered trucks departed from Xiaoyi in coal-rich Shanxi Province, traveling over 700 kilometers before successfully delivering their coal cargo to Tianjin Port.
""This marks a milestone,"" said Zheng Peng, chairman of Pengfei Group, the manufacturer of these hydrogen-fueled heavy trucks. ""They reopened the road transport route to Tianjin Port, which stopped receiving coal transported by road seven years ago due to environmental concerns.""
Pengfei Group recently secured an order for 500 hydrogen-powered heavy trucks, each priced at 1.07 million yuan (about 150,400 U.S. dollars). From 2025 to 2028, the company plans to deploy at least 1,000 trucks annually.
Previously, Xiaoyi had introduced 200 hydrogen-powered heavy trucks to its key industrial enterprises, with each truck averaging over 100,000 kilometers in mileage.
Although hydrogen production, storage, and transport remain costly, hydrogen-powered heavy trucks are becoming more common in commercial use due to their fixed routes, which make it easier to establish refueling stations and thus more economically viable.
Local officials are optimistic that technological advancements and an improved industrial chain will reduce the production costs of hydrogen-powered heavy trucks, potentially reaching parity with diesel trucks within two to three years.
Home to fewer than 500,000 residents, Xiaoyi is a traditional industrial city with a coal production capacity of 31.3 million tonnes in 2022. Approximately 70 percent of its GDP was derived from industry.
""Hydrogen energy, as a representative of new quality productive forces in the energy sector, has strong momentum and promising prospects,"" said Guo Qingzhi, mayor of Xiaoyi.
""With the city's substantial industrial economy, the potential for expanding industrial applications of hydrogen energy is vast,"" echoed vice mayor Xue Zhiqiang.
Hydrogen energy was highlighted in China's government work report this year for the first time as a crucial emerging industry, as the country seeks to meet its carbon-emission targets.
According to a report by Sinopec Group, China's major oil refiner, the country's hydrogen energy consumption is projected to reach nearly 86 million tonnes by 2060, with an industry scale of 4.6 trillion yuan.
China aims to have 50,000 hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles on the road by 2025, a government plan on the hydrogen sector noted. And the number is estimated to rocket to one million by 2035, according to the China Society of Automotive Engineers.
Xiaoyi is not alone in promoting hydrogen energy. China's largest green hydrogen production and refueling station has been established in Changsha, Hunan Province, and the world's first hydrogen-powered urban train, developed by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles Co., Ltd., completed its inaugural run at a speed of 160 kilometers per hour in Jilin Province.
""As a coal-rich province, Shanxi has a natural cost advantage in hydrogen production,"" said an official from the provincial industry and information technology department.
Xiaoyi's hankering to harness the power of hydrogen has expanded to bikes and buses. In late April, 500 shared hydrogen-powered bikes were launched. They can travel 60 kilometers on just 60 grams of hydrogen. Additionally, five hydrogen buses were deployed for intercity transportation, with a 30-kilometer journey costing just three yuan.
""Hydrogen energy is indispensable in my life,"" said Xiaoyi resident Zhang Aisheng, who also drives a hydrogen bus. Every morning, he rides a hydrogen bicycle to work, drives the bus to transport commuters, and then rides the bike home after his shift.
The city is advancing projects worth a total investment of 78 billion yuan, including hydrogen production, refueling stations and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle manufacturing. Upon completion, these projects are expected to generate an annual output value of 180 billion yuan and create 35,000 jobs.
""The city of Xiaoyi is committed to accelerating the development of the hydrogen energy industry by leveraging all available resources and expertise to achieve high-quality growth in this sector,"" said the city's mayor.

As of the end of May, China had erected 9.92 million chargers throughout the country, marking a significant 56 percent year-on-year expansion, Li Chao, an official from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a press conference on Tuesday.
Among them, public charging facilities totaled 3.05 million units, surging 46 percent year on year, while the number of private charging facilities climbed 61 percent to about 6.87 million units, according to Li.
This impressive growth aligns with the flourishing new energy vehicle (NEV) sector in China, which is the world's largest market for NEVs. Both production and sales figures are experiencing rapid growth.
Li anticipated a continued rise in demand for NEVs among Chinese consumers, further driving the necessity for expanding charging infrastructure.
For the next step, the NDRC will work with other departments to promote the construction and renovation of community charging facilities tailored to local needs, while providing greater support for charging infrastructure development in rural areas.
The country aims to add 3,000 charging piles and 5,000 charging parking spaces in highway service areas this year, Li added.

In the first five months of this year, investment in the purchase of equipment and appliances increased by 17.5 percent year on year, contributing more than 50 percent to the total investment growth in the country, NDRC spokesperson Li Chao told a press conference on Tuesday.
During the period, sales generated from home appliance replacements surged more than 80 percent from a year earlier on major e-commerce platforms, Li said, noting that replacing old appliances has become an important factor promoting the growth of home appliance consumption.
Meanwhile, a large number of intelligent recycling facilities have been provided to communities around the country, which has improved China's recycling system, the spokesperson added.
The country has already completed the construction of the policy system for promoting large-scale equipment renewals and replacing old consumer goods with new ones, while local governments across 31 provincial-level regions have all released action plans for the program.
The country is also gradually implementing financial support for the program, with 6.44 billion yuan (about 905 million U.S. dollars) worth of central government funds allocated for supporting trade-ins of automobiles and 500 million yuan for supporting the scrapping of old agricultural machinery, according to the NDRC.

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun",Economy,20240618,1401,,,"PV industry creates win-win ecological, economic benefits in desert","LANZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- In the Jiuduntan photovoltaic demonstration park in the northwest of China, rows of solar panels stretch like ribbons into the heart of the Tengger Desert. Beneath these panels, desert vegetation thrives.
Located in Liangzhou District, in the city of Wuwei, Gansu Province, this project exemplifies efforts to combat desertification while fostering economic growth.
Boasting a planned area of over 33,000 hectares, more than a dozen companies have already settled in, with an installed capacity of 2.2 million kilowatts, of which 1.5 million kilowatts are already connected to the grid.
""I never dared to imagine that I could make a living in the desert,"" said Qin Zhaoping, a local farmer from Hengliang Township, who is now working for a company in the demonstration park. His job involves maintaining the irrigation system beneath the solar panels and nurturing the desert plants.
""The development of the photovoltaic industry, alongside desert control, benefits future generations,"" Qin noted, adding that the project not only generates electricity and stabilizes sand but also enhances local income levels.
To support this project, related departments and enterprises also join in the irrigation efforts.
""Generating electricity above the panels and cultivating desert vegetation below achieves dual benefits -- efficient utilization of solar resources and desert stabilization,"" said Zhang Kewei, who is in charge of the management of the demonstration park.
Currently, the area of desert vegetation within the park amounts to about 3,200 hectares.
According to researchers, desert plants cultivated under the solar panels in the demonstration park can be harvested for fodder after three years of growth, while there are plans to introduce a poultry farming industry in the same area within the next few years.
Last month, the National Energy Administration and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration issued a notice promoting the development of photovoltaic sand control projects.
This initiative allows for the integration of photovoltaic development with traditional sand control methods in regions like Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi and Qinghai. By prioritizing ecological protection, these projects are designed to be scientifically implemented, supporting the creation of a clean, low-carbon, safe and efficient new energy system while advancing high-quality desertification control.
Zhang Xuchen, director of the Gansu provincial forestry and grassland department, said that in the future, the city of Wuwei plans to assist local farmers in developing industries such as forage grass cultivation, desert vegetation planting and poultry farming. This approach aims to maximize the ecological, economic, and social benefits of integrating the photovoltaic industry with sand control efforts.
