The decision was made on Thursday at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, which was chaired by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee.
In the past, the third plenums of the CPC Central Committee have often launched major reforms.

This year's third plenum carries historical significance given the structural economic slowdown, global geopolitical tensions and an increasing emphasis on coordinating development and security, observers said.
On the top of the agenda of the plenum is that the Political Bureau will report its work to the CPC Central Committee with a focus on studying the issues of further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernization.

Regarding the goals and objectives for further reform, the statement said that China will complete the building of a high-standard socialist market economy by 2035.
The system and capacity for governance will be basically modernized and socialist modernization will be basically achieved by 2035, it added.
The plenum comes as China faces challenges in its structural economic readjustment as well as risks arising from mounting international geopolitical competition.

The mainland and Taiwan both belong to one and the same China, and Taiwan is a part of China. This fact cannot and will never be changed, Zhu said. She also criticized Lai's remarks as being false and lacking both historical and legal basis, while only serving to expose his separatist intentions.
Concerning cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation, Zhu said the mainland always supports and promotes dialogue and consultation between the two sides of the Strait based on the ""1992 Consensus,"" thereby actively enhancing cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation.
""The root cause hindering cross-Strait communication lies in the Democratic Progressive Party authorities' stubborn adherence to the 'Taiwan independence' separatist stance and their refusal to acknowledge the '1992 Consensus,'"" Zhu said.
The spokesperson added that Lai, while claiming to promote the people's well-being and a future of peace and common prosperity on both sides of the Strait, is instead repeatedly advocating the ""two states"" theory, inciting cross-Strait confrontation and seeking separatist schemes.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Politics,20240626,1005,,,"Judicial guidelines on punishing ""Taiwan independence"" separatists win public support","TAIPEI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Public opinion in Taiwan holds that the recent judicial guidelines on punishing diehard ""Taiwan independence"" separatists will help prevent the situation in the Taiwan Strait from worsening further.
Chinese authorities on Friday issued a set of guidelines on imposing criminal punishments on diehard ""Taiwan independence"" separatists for conducting or inciting secession, allowing the death penalty and trials in absentia in relevant cases.
Based on the Anti-Secession Law, the Criminal Law, and the Criminal Procedure Law, the guidelines took effect upon release.
The move has attracted great attention from a wide spectrum in Taiwan, and local people believe that the document, with teeth to enforce, will effectively deter the diehard ""Taiwan independence"" separatists.
The Taiwan-based China Times on Monday said in an editorial that judicial actions against ""Taiwan independence"" statements and acts are not surprising, given the fact that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) cares nothing about the kinship among the people on the two sides of the Strait, turns a blind eye to the historical bond between the two sides that share the same culture and roots, and is frequently obstructing cross-Strait exchanges.
An editorial published by Taiwan's Want Daily said the guidelines, which came after Lai Ching-te, leader of the Taiwan region, publicly advocated the ""two states"" theory, will prevent the situation across the Strait from sliding to an extreme one and will serve as a guarantee for cross-Strait exchanges and peaceful reunification.
Liu Xing-ren, an associate professor at Chinese Culture University, noted that the mainland has zero tolerance for acts by diehard separatists seeking ""Taiwan independence.""
Liu said the guidelines explicitly target ""Taiwan independence"" and have dealt a thorough and precise blow against separatist forces.
Chi Hsing, with the Taiwan-based magazine The Observer, believes the guidelines are aimed at a very small number of diehard ""Taiwan independence"" separatists and will not affect the outlook of cross-Strait exchanges. ""Taiwan residents will not worry as long as they learn about it,"" Chi said.
Hsiao Hsu-tsen, director of the Ma Ying-jeou Culture and Education Foundation, says that the mainland has drawn a clear line between ""the vast majority of people in Taiwan"" and ""Taiwan independence"" separatists, indicating that the cross-Strait people-to-people exchanges will not be interrupted.
""The best way for cross-Strait peace is to return to the '1992 Consensus',"" said Lai Cheng-yi, honorable chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan.

People.cn,"Xue Yanyan, Zhong Wenxing",Politics,20240622,1015,,,"Xi stresses ecological conservation on Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, high-quality development","BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping, Chinese president, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that Qinghai Province should conscientiously implement the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee, and fully and faithfully implement the new development philosophy on all fronts. He was on an inspection tour in the province. Xi said that Qinghai should have a clear understanding of its strategic positioning in the overall development of the country, fully leverage its own advantages, firmly deepen reform, expand opening up, prioritize ecological conservation and pursue green development. He urged the province to uphold ethnic unity and seek common prosperity, and make greater progress in promoting eco-environmental protection and high-quality development on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, so as to write its own chapter in advancing Chinese modernization.
From June 18 to 19, Xi visited a middle school and a religious venue in the provincial capital Xining, accompanied by Chen Gang, secretary of CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee, and Wu Xiaojun, provincial governor.
On the afternoon of June 18, Xi first came to Golog Xining Ethnic Middle School. It is a boarding school that was funded and built with assistance from Shanghai and is attached to Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Xi was briefed on how Shanghai and other eastern regions have assisted Qinghai's education work and school construction, asked in detail about the composition of students, school's curriculum, students' physical exercise, putonghua proficiency and other information. He walked into the canteen and dormitory building to inspect the students' dining and accommodation conditions, and told the canteen staff to ensure that students are provided with safe, nutritious and tasty food.
After that, Xi came to the classroom of Class 1 of grade 1 of high school to observe the ideological and political class themed ""New Era, New Hometown."" Xi was very happy to learn that the school has integrated ideological and political lessons into its daily teaching, listen to the students talking about the gratifying changes in their hometown in the new era, and see the students' paintings. Xi said that the collaboration between the country's eastern and western regions as well as paired assistance, particularly in education, has yielded remarkable results. This fully showcases the strengths of the CPC's leadership and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, as well as the support for each other among members of the big family of the Chinese nation, Xi said.
Xi stressed the need to make it a key task of school ideological and political lessons to foster a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation, tell well the story of the CPC and socialism with Chinese characteristics, the story of comprehensively promoting the building of a strong country and the realization of national rejuvenation through Chinese modernization in the new era, and the story of the community for the Chinese nation as well as ethnic unity and progress, so that the sense of community for the Chinese nation can be implanted in the hearts of children since childhood.
On the square in front of the classroom building, Xi was surrounded by the faculty and students who greeted him loudly. Xi said, ""I come to visit you teachers and students at my first stop in Xining."" He emphasized the achievements and importance of the school, which was built with fund and assistance from Shanghai and accommodates ethnic minority students from the pastoral areas of Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. He expressed the hope that the students will cherish the favorable conditions of the school, be grateful, study hard, and develop sound moral grounding, intellectual ability, physical vigor, aesthetic sensibility, and work skills. They should aspire to become successors to and builders of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, striving to create opportunities for developing a distinguished career. Xi also wished them success in their study and healthy growth.
Then, Xi arrived at Hongjue Temple in downtown Xining. In the front courtyard, chief of the democratic management committee of the temple presented Xi with a Khata, a ceremonial white scarf symbolizing goodwill and blessings, and monks greeted him holding incense burners and parasols. Xi visited an exhibition by the provincial educational base for ethnic unity and progress. He learned about the temple's history and was briefed on how veteran revolutionaries cared about ethnic and religious affairs. He walked into the main hall and was briefed on the temple's efforts to strengthen daily management and promote ethnic unity and progress. Xi pointed out that the centuries-old Hongjue Temple had played an important role as a bridge in strengthening the bond between the central government and Tibetan Buddhism over generations. It is essential to protect this precious historical and cultural heritage and make further contributions to forging a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation and promoting ethnic unity and progress. He noted the need to learn from veteran revolutionaries and do a better job in the Party's united front, ethnic and religious work in the new era. Xi stressed that to build a strong country and advance national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernization, the Chinese people of all ethnic groups around the country including religious believers should strive in unity. He expressed the hope that the Tibetan Buddhist circle in the province should carry forward the fine traditions of patriotism and religious piety, help promote religious, social and ethnic harmony, and play a positive role in advancing Chinese modernization.
On the morning of June 19, Xi was briefed on the work of the province by the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee and the provincial government, and he affirmed what the province has achieved in various aspects of its work.
Xi noted that Qinghai shoulders the important mission of safeguarding the country's ecological security, and as far as industrial development is concerned, the province must do what it should and never do what it should not, so as to build a modern industrial system that reflects Qinghai's characteristics and advantages. The province is urged to effectively pool resources to speed up building itself into a world-class salt lake industrial base, a national highland for clean energy industry, a destination for international ecological tourism, and a supplier of green and organic agricultural and livestock products. The province should attach equal importance to scientific and technological research and development and the application of sci-tech achievements. New technologies should be applied extensively, traditional industries transformed and upgraded according to local conditions, and emerging strategic industries developed to foster new quality productive forces. Further efforts are required to deepen reform on all fronts and expand opening up and optimize the business environment. The province should also align its development with that of major strategies such as the Yangtze River Economic Belt and promote the development of the green Silk Road. Qinghai should coordinate regional development within the province, give full play to the supportive role of Xining, Haidong and Haixi, and develop county economies and industries with local features according to local conditions.
Xi stressed it as the region's major task to strengthen ecological conservation and environmental protection and maximize its ecological functions since the ecosystem of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is diverse yet fragile. It is imperative for the province to prioritize eco-environmental protection, advance green development, conscientiously execute the law concerning ecological conservation on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau and implement on all fronts the plans and requirements entailed by its principal zone function so as to build the plateau into a hub for ecological conservation. It is imperative for the province to persist with a holistic and systematic approach to conserving and improving mountain, water, forest, farmland, grassland, and desert ecosystems. Efforts should be made to accelerate the implementation of major projects for the conserving and restoring of key ecosystems, and consolidate and enhance what has been achieved in ecological conservation and environmental protection. The utmost priority is to conserve the source region of three major rivers, also known as ""the water tower of China,"" protect biodiversity, and boost water conservation capacity. Efforts should also be made to strengthen the establishment of a nature reserve system with national parks as the mainstay and build exemplary nature reserves with national characteristics and global influence. It is necessary to promote energy conservation and carbon reduction in key sectors in an orderly manner, develop eco-friendly industries, and accelerate the development of a new energy system.
Xi noted that concrete measures must be taken to ensure and improve people's well-being. The province is urged to do everything within its capacities, make concrete efforts to meet people's needs, deliver real benefits to the people, and win their approval, and take solid steps to resolve the pressing difficulties and problems that concern people most. It is also a must to coordinate and plan the layout of basic public service facilities and put more efforts into making public services more balanced and accessible. Rural revitalization should focus on increasing the income of farmers and herdsmen, and efforts should be accelerated to invigorate characteristic seed industries of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, develop green and organic agricultural and animal husbandry, and promote native product brands of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. It is also necessary to advance the construction of beautiful rural areas on the Plateau and promote the transformation of outdated rural customs. Monitoring and assistance mechanisms should be implemented to prevent those lifted out of poverty from falling back to poverty, and see that no large number of people become poverty-stricken again. It is imperative for the province to continue to do a good job in the post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction of Jishishan and improve disaster prevention, mitigation, and relief capabilities.
Xi stressed that Qinghai is a province with concentrated ethnic minority groups, and it is essential to keep doing a good job in the work concerning ethnic and religious affairs. The province should fully implement the Party's major principles and policies for ethnic affairs in the new era, make it a main task to consolidate the sense of community for the Chinese nation, make efforts to promote ethnic unity and progress, and facilitate all-round integration and extensive exchanges and interactions among all ethnic groups. It is necessary for the province to fully implement the theories, principles and policies of the Party's religious work in the new era, uphold the principle of developing religions in the Chinese context, and strengthen the administration of religious affairs, especially the administration of religious venues, in accordance with the law.
Xi pointed out that the campaign to study the Party discipline across the entire Party is on-going, and the campaign must be carried out in earnest so that real outcome can be achieved. It is a must for the Party discipline to be enforced and abided by to the letter when the campaign has brought home its importance. It is essential to vigorously carry forward the zeitgeist with reform and innovation at its core and the spirit of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, so as to inspire Party members and officials to further emancipate their minds and update their thinking, as well as take firm steps and shoulder responsibilities. Concerted work must be done to enhance Party consciousness, improve Party conduct, and tighten Party discipline, and endeavors in this regard should facilitate fight against corruption. Work on improving Party conduct must continue permanently and further fight against pointless formalities so as to reduce burden on primary-level officials. Coordinated steps should be taken to see that officials do not have the audacity, opportunity, or desire to be corrupt so that a wholesome political atmosphere will help create a positive and upright social environment.
Li Ganjie, He Lifeng, and leading officials from relevant Party and state departments accompanied Xi on the inspection tour.

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun",Politics,20240620,1314,,,"Xi stresses conserving Qinghai-Xizang Plateau ecology, high-quality development","XINING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed continued efforts to protect the ecology of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau during an inspection tour in Qinghai Province from Tuesday to Wednesday.
Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, also called on the province to promote high-quality development through deepening reform, expanding opening-up, and pursuing green development, ethnic unity and common prosperity.
The plateau, located in northwest China, boasts rich, diverse yet fragile ecosystems. It is home to the Sanjiangyuan area, dubbed as ""the water tower of China,"" where the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Lancang River originate.
Qinghai is a province with concentrated ethnic minority groups.
On Tuesday afternoon, Xi went to a middle school in the provincial capital Xining. It is a boarding school funded and built with assistance from Shanghai and accommodates ethnic minority students from the pastoral areas in Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.
Xi visited the school's canteen, a dormitory building, and a classroom where he listened to the students telling how their hometown had changed and viewed the students' drawings.
Xi highlighted the notable achievements of the collaboration between the country's eastern and western regions as well as paired assistance, particularly in education.
This fully showcases the strength of the Party's leadership and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, as well as the support for each other among members of the big family of the Chinese nation, Xi said.
Paired assistance plays a crucial role in China's development. The pairing of developed and underdeveloped regions is widespread across sectors including healthcare, education, and industries. Within this framework, capital, skilled workers, and other resources are directed from wealthier regions to those lagging behind to foster their development.
On the campus square, Xi was surrounded by the faculty and students. He expressed the hope that the students will study hard and strive for a bright future.
Later, Xi visited the centuries-old Hongjue Temple. He said the temple had played an important role as a bridge in strengthening the bond between the central government and Tibetan Buddhism over generations.
""It is essential to protect this precious historical and cultural heritage, and renew efforts to foster a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation and promote ethnic unity and progress,"" Xi said.
He expressed the hope for the Tibetan Buddhist circle in the province to carry on the fine traditions of patriotism, help promote religious, social and ethnic harmony, and play an active role in advancing Chinese modernization.

President Xi Jinping has underscored the importance of enhancing political loyalty in the military in the new era and providing a firm political guarantee for building a strong military.
Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that the world, the nation, the Party and the Chinese military have been undergoing deep and sophisticated changes, and the country's armed forces are facing a range of complex challenges.
Under such circumstances, the military must continue to make all-out efforts to strengthen its political building, uphold political loyalty and purity, and stick to its missions, he said.
The military also must strive to hone its troops' combat capabilities, maintain its solidarity and fighting spirit, train more skillful professionals, and ensure strong discipline in order to keep intensifying its political strength in the new era, according to Xi.
He made the remarks on Monday when addressing senior commanders at a military political work conference in Yan'an, Shaanxi province, an important cradle of the Chinese revolution led by the CPC.
During the speech, Xi expounded his views on deep-rooted issues that must be solved to make way for political building inside the armed forces, stressing that the origin of such issues lies in the deterioration of some service members' spirit and morals.
He said officers, especially those in high positions, should carry out self-reflection and correct any problems.
The commander in chief urged the armed forces to enhance their political education, improve Party organizations' management and their overall capabilities, and strengthen the selection, training and management of officers. He also called for eradicating hotbeds of corruption and promoting comprehensive disciplinary supervision, cracking down on red tape and excessive bureaucracy and meeting the actual needs of troops, and restoring and upholding time-honored political traditions, such as senior officers setting an example by observing rules and fulfilling duties.
Xi said that it is a duty of all members in the military to promote political building, adding that related departments under the Central Military Commission and units of the armed forces must work together to push forward such work.
By doing so, the military, under the Party's guidance, will become stronger and will march toward its centenary in 2027 with new achievements, according to Xi.
Before addressing the conference, Xi and a group of top commanders had a guided tour of Wangjiaping, a historical site in Yan'an, which was home to the Central Military Commission from 1937 to 1947.
After the tour, the president asked that all senior officers should keep in mind their initial aspirations and missions, become role models for their troops, and shoulder their responsibilities to lead their units in the fight for realizing the military's centenary goals.
Hundreds of high-ranking officers took part in the three-day meeting, which was organized by the Central Military Commission. Attendees listened to Xi's instructions, held panel discussions and shared their thoughts during the event, which concluded on Wednesday.
The last time such a meeting was held was in 2014, with senior officers convening in Gutian, Fujian province. That was the first time the military arranged a top-level political work conference since Xi became general secretary in late 2012.

YAN'AN, Shaanxi, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the armed forces' political loyalty as a crucial meeting on the political work in the military was held in Yan'an, an old revolutionary base in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), demanded efforts to ensure a solid political guarantee for building a strong military, as he addressed the CMC Political Work Conference, held from Monday to Wednesday.
The Yan'an conference, which Xi personally decided to convene, took place 10 years after a similar meeting was held in Gutian, east China's Fujian Province. The participants discussed and made arrangements for promoting political work in the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
Xi emphasized the need to uphold the Party's absolute leadership over the military and to build a high-quality cadre team that is loyal, clean, responsible, and capable of fulfilling the mission of strengthening the military.
On Monday afternoon, Xi led CMC members and heads of various departments and units to visit the revolutionary relics at Wangjiaping, where the CMC's headquarters were stationed from August 1937 to March 1947.
Xi visited the former residences of late revolutionary leaders including Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Zhu De in Yan'an to honor the memory of their revolutionary struggle.
The Yan'an conference marks a return to the roots of the military, Xi said.
He called on senior military officers to shoulder the responsibilities entrusted by the Party and the people to keep strengthening the armed forces.
Xi delivered an important speech at the conference, noting that after the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the CPC Central Committee held the 2014 military political work conference in Gutian and improved political conduct through rectification initiatives.
Measures to govern the military with strict discipline have been comprehensively implemented with unprecedented determination and intensity, achieving historic accomplishments in enhancing political loyalty in the military, according to Xi.
Xi stressed that political work is always the lifeline of the country's military. The armed forces must always be led by those who are reliable and loyal to the Party, and there must be no place for corruption within the military.
Noting that China's military is confronted with complicated challenges in the political work, Xi said it is necessary to continuously enhance political loyalty in the military to ensure that the people's armed forces always uphold their core values, maintain purity, and strictly adhere to discipline.
He also analyzed the deep-seated problems that need to be addressed in military political work, emphasizing that a root cause of these problems lies in the lack of ideals and beliefs.
Xi called on relevant personnel at all levels, especially senior cadres, to introspect, engage in soul-searching reflections, and make earnest rectifications.
Xi highlighted key work to enhance political loyalty in the military, urging efforts to arm the military with the Party's new theories and improve the leadership of Party organizations, as well as their capabilities of organization and implementation.
The Party leadership must be upheld in all the fields and the whole process of enhancing combat readiness, Xi noted.
Xi urged efforts to nurture a contingent of high-caliber officers, eradicate the breeding ground for corruption, and enhance the comprehensive oversight of high-ranking officers in terms of their performance of duty and exercise of power.
Officers at all levels, especially those in the higher ranks, should lead by example and serve as pioneers and models, Xi said.

People.cn,"Wu Chaolan, Liang Jun",Politics,20240619,1343,,,China allays concerns regarding tax inspections,"BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China's tax authority has clarified reported tax inspections, saying it has not launched any nationwide or industry-wide campaign in this respect.
The announcement by the State Taxation Administration (STA) came amid public concerns in the wake of some enterprises reportedly being instructed to pay tax bills dating back to 30 years ago.
There is also no such arrangement as scrutinizing tax bills dating back 20 or 30 years ago, the STA said.
The administration has paid close attention to the relevant reports, and fully understands the concerns of business entities and the public, it added.
Some reported tax inspections targeted the recent tax arrears of enterprises, and some were conducted to remind and notify enterprises of taxation policies and the potential risks of violations. These are routine performances of duties by tax departments in accordance with laws and regulations, the STA said.
It is the duty of the tax departments to support the development of enterprises, said the administration, noting that the sound operation of businesses is the source of tax revenues.
China's tax departments will resolutely implement the preferential tax and fee policies, strictly prevent illegal taxation and tax collection violations, and help various business entities develop in a healthy and law-abiding way, it stated.
The administration said it is the statutory duty of tax departments to strengthen tax oversight, pledging to further optimize tax law enforcement means.
Tax authorities will work to further promote precise oversight and law enforcement, and crack down on tax misconduct to create a business environment of fair competition for law-abiding enterprises, the STA concluded.

People.cn,"Wu Chaolan, Liang Jun",Politics,20240619,953,,,"Xi urges all-out efforts to fight floods, droughts","Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged all-out efforts to fight floods and droughts and ensure solid work in disaster relief to safeguard people's lives and property as well as social stability, Xinhua News Agency reported on Tuesday.
Chinese authorities have been working at full capacity to combat floods in part of the southern regions and drought in the northern regions. The measures include allocating central disaster relief supplies and increasing funds for agricultural disaster prevention.
Meizhou in South China's Guangdong Province has experienced heavy rainstorms since Sunday, with some areas experiencing severe flooding, leading to people being trapped, houses collapsing, roads being washed away, and disruptions in power and communication. The city has been working to rescue those in danger and minimize the damage caused by the disaster, local authorities stated on Tuesday.
Water levels measured from the main streams of Meijiang and Hanjiang rivers are slowly receding. Local Meizhou authorities lowered the flood control emergency response from level I to level II as of 11 am on Tuesday.
Local officials and emergency response personnel went door-to-door to notify residents to evacuate in a timely manner. Meanwhile, rescuers shuttled between residential buildings, evacuating trapped residents to relocation areas.
As of 11 am on Tuesday, the heavy rain in Meizhou had affected more than 164,000 people. By 10 pm on Monday, a total of 56,867 people in Meizhou had been relocated, according to media reports. By Monday, flash floods and landslides in Meizhou had resulted in five deaths and 15 people have gone missing, according to local authorities.
In Pingyuan county, one of the most-affected counties of Meizhou, there are a total of 381 damaged sections of road. The local power grid has deployed 18 generators, four power vehicles, and 118 emergency lights to provide temporary power supply to affected areas. As of 6 am on Tuesday, power has been restored to 23,605 households in Pingyuan county, with nearly half of the affected households having electricity restored, authorities confirmed.
While the waters are receding and residents in some areas are recovering from the disaster, four townships in the northeastern region of Pingyuan county, including Sishui, are among the hardest hit. In some villages, mobile communications and electricity are still to be restored, leaving residents to rely on satellite communications, a working staff from the Pingyuan county government told the Global Times on Tuesday.
Roads in these towns are also impassable and are still being repaired. Provincial emergency management authorities have dispatched helicopters to deliver essential supplies and rescuers to the worst hit regions, while evacuating the injured or vulnerable.
The local police in Pingyuan on Monday morning conducted a successful rescue operation in Bailing village, using drones with thermal imaging equipment to locate and deliver supplies to three trapped residents, according to the local authorities.
Ma Ping, a local official from Bailing village, died in a landslide while evacuating residents on Monday, according to media reports.
Some areas in Dongshi town of Pingyuan experienced communication disruptions due to heavy rains on Monday early morning, with signals restored by noon the same day. Despite a bridge being destroyed in the town, the local authorities are making efforts to ensure essential supplies for villagers, a local resident surnamed Liu told the Global Times on Tuesday.
A member from Blue Sky Rescue Team from Jiangdong new area in Heyuan of Guangdong told the Global Times on Tuesday that they were deployed to Dabu county on Monday with rescue equipment to help people who were trapped by flooding, prioritizing the evacuation of the elderly, children and pregnant women.

People.cn,"Wu Chaolan, Liang Jun",Politics,20240619,950,,,"Xi urges all-out response to floods, drought","President Xi Jinping has urged an all-out response to the recent floods and drought conditions that have hit different regions across the country, saying that utmost efforts must be made in the search for and rescue of missing and trapped individuals and the resettlement of affected residents.
Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, highlighted in an instruction published on Tuesday the importance of maintaining normal production and daily routines and minimizing disaster losses to the greatest extent possible.
He noted that heavy rainfall has recently hit many regions in southern China, triggering floods and geological disasters in provinces including Guangdong and Fujian and leading to casualties and property damage.
Meanwhile, drought conditions in parts of North China have become more severe, he said.
As China is set to face more challenges in flood control with the start of the main flood season, Xi urged authorities at all levels to strengthen their risk awareness, think about worst-case scenarios and ensure that their responsibilities are fulfilled and make solid work in disaster relief.
He also stressed the need to strengthen disaster monitoring and early warning, identify and eliminate potential risks, stock up on equipment and supplies, improve contingency plans, and effectively respond to various emergencies to ensure the safety of people and their property.
The nation has ramped up its flood control and disaster relief measures as floods triggered by rainstorms wreaked havoc in southern China. Meanwhile, scorching heat is baking central and northern China, with many national weather stations registering record-breaking daily high temperatures.
On Monday, the national commission for disaster prevention, reduction and relief responded to the severe rainstorm and flood disasters in Fujian and Guangdong provinces by initiating a Level 4 emergency response, the lowest in a four-tier system. Task forces were deployed to the disaster-affected regions to assist relief efforts and ensure that the basic living needs of residents are met.
Five people died and 15 others were missing after heavy rainfall hit multiple areas in Meizhou, Guangdong province, starting on Sunday, and led to power outages, internet disruptions and waterlogging.
Rainstorms have also resulted in four deaths and two people missing in Wuping county, Fujian province, as of Monday. In the province's Shanghang county, rain-triggered floods killed four people as of Tuesday.
Chen Tao, chief forecaster at the National Meteorological Center, said that as the western Pacific subtropical high gradually strengthened and moved northward starting on Tuesday, precipitation in Fujian and Guangdong will significantly decrease.
However, from Tuesday through the end of the month, the central and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will experience concentrated rainfall. Parts of the region will receive precipitation of more than 300 millimeters, which is more than twice the usual amount for the same period in a typical year, Chen said.
Jia Xiaolong, deputy director of the National Climate Center, said the lagging effect of the El Nino phenomenon may result in comparatively bad summer climate conditions, with extreme weather events becoming more frequent and floods being more prevalent than droughts. Precipitation levels in the eastern monsoon region are expected to be higher than usual, and regional and episodic flooding disasters will be prominent.
The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs announced on Tuesday the allocation of 443 million yuan ($61 million) to seven provinces in northern, central and eastern China — Hebei, He-nan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi Jiangsu and Anhui — in response to drought-induced damage to crops caused by prolonged heat and insufficient rainfall.
The funds will be primarily used to provide subsidies for agricultural drought-resistant measures such as watering, soil moisture replenishment, crop conversion and additional fertilization to ensure the successful completion of the critical summer sowing stage.
Wang Weiyue, a meteorological analyst at Weather China, warned of a sudden shift between drought conditions and flooding.
As the rain belt moves northward, some areas in southern China will experience less precipitation and hotter temperatures. Meanwhile, areas of southern and eastern Hubei, central and northern Anhui and Jiangsu, which were previously affected by drought conditions, will see frequent rainfall in the next two weeks, Wang said.
Preparations should be made in these areas to prevent secondary disasters such as mountain floods, landslides, debris flows, and floods in small and medium-sized rivers, he added.

Zhang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the remarks during an inspection tour in Guangdong Province and Shanghai Municipality from Friday to Tuesday.
During the tour, he visited enterprises and research institutions in industries including electronic information, biomedicine, commercial aerospace, shipbuilding and artificial intelligence, in the cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shanghai.
Zhang urged deepening the integration of scientific and technological innovation with industrial innovation, accelerating industrial application of innovative achievements, and guiding small and medium-sized enterprises to specialize in a niche market and develop cutting-edge technologies.
Efforts should be made to promote large-scale equipment and technological upgrades in the manufacturing industry, accelerate the construction and popularization of the industrial internet, promote energy conservation and carbon reduction technologies, and develop green manufacturing, said Zhang.
Noting that recent heavy and persistent rainfall has led to flooding and geological disasters in parts of the south, Zhang said no effort should be spared to carry out flood prevention as well as rescue and relief work, improve disaster monitoring and early warning, strengthen inspection in disaster-prone areas, promptly evacuate those people affected, and ensure the safety of people's lives and property.

Xi called for all-out efforts to deal with the disaster, do everything possible to search and rescue those missing or trapped, properly resettle those affected, ensure production and life order, and minimize losses.
Xi emphasized that as China enters the flood season, the flood control situation is growing increasingly severe. He urged all regions and relevant departments to strengthen risk awareness, prepare for worst-case scenarios, make those in charge have stronger sense of responsibility, and strengthen comprehensive planning, so as to ensure that work is consolidated in flood control, drought relief, emergency response, and disaster relief.
Xi also urged efforts to strengthen monitoring and early warning for disasters, ferret hazards in a timely manner, prepare adequate supplies and equipment, and better work plans, thus effectively tackling emergencies to safeguard people's lives and property as well as social stability.

(Xinhua/Shen Hong)
XIAMEN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Senior official Wang Huning on Saturday stressed that China has the resolve, confidence and ability to shatter separatist attempts for ""Taiwan independence"" in any form.
Wang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made the statement while addressing the main conference of the 16th Straits Forum in Xiamen, southeast China's Fujian Province.
The speech made by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, in April has pointed out the direction for the development of cross-Strait relations and peace and stability in the Strait, Wang said.
He called on people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to shoulder their historical and national responsibilities, firmly oppose ""Taiwan independence"" separatism and foreign interference, steadfastly safeguard the common homeland of the Chinese nation, promote peace and tranquility across the Strait, and work together to push cross-Strait relations back onto the right path.
Separatists seeking ""Taiwan independence"" undermine peace and stability between the two sides of the Strait, harm the interests and well-being of people in Taiwan, and jeopardize national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Wang said, adding that their actions will push Taiwan to the brink of war and bring disaster to people on the island.
He pledged that the mainland will continue enhancing the interests and well-being of the people of Taiwan, and welcome more of them to participate in cross-Strait exchange, cooperation and integrated development.
He also expressed the hope that young people on both sides of the Strait will engage in more exchanges and interactions, develop mutual understanding, and work together to realize the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Sean Lien, vice chair of the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT), said the KMT has always promoted cross-Strait exchange and cooperation, based on the common political foundation of upholding the 1992 Consensus and opposing ""Taiwan independence.""
People on both sides of the Strait, all of whom are Chinese, should face challenges together and strive for peace and prosperity for future generations of the Chinese nation.
Ahead of the conference, Wang met with guests from Taiwan who are attending the forum.

The article by Xi, also Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, will appear in this year's 12th issue of the Qiushi Journal, a flagship magazine of the CPC Central Committee. The article consists of excerpts from Xi's relevant discourses from October 2017 to March 2024.
Noting that China's economy has been transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development, the article stresses that high-quality development is the theme of the country's economic and social development in the 14th Five-year Plan period (2021-2025) and beyond, and the first and foremost task in building a modern socialist country in all respects.
High-quality development can meet the people's ever-growing desire for a better life, and it means a change from seeking growth to seeking better growth, according to the article.
It highlights the tasks of speeding up efforts to achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, moving faster to create a new pattern of development, and developing new quality productive forces.
Different regions should embark on a path of high-quality development suited to their own realities, says the article.
It underscores promoting in-depth reform and high-level opening up in a coordinated manner, coordinating high-quality development and high-level security, improving the assessment and evaluation system for promoting high-quality development, and planning major moves to deepen overall reform in order to continuously inject strong impetus into promoting high-quality development and advancing Chinese modernization.

People.cn,"Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun",Politics,20240617,1517,,,Explainer: Understand the value of Straits Forum in promoting exchanges,"XIAMEN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- As the situation in the Taiwan Strait becomes increasingly complex and severe, more people-to-people exchanges through such platforms as the Straits Forum are definitely a boon to cross-Strait relations.
The 16th edition of the forum held on Saturday in Xiamen, Fujian Province, is an occasion to convey such a message: no matter how the cross-Strait situation may change, the mainland always promotes cross-strait exchanges and integration.
Since its inauguration in 2009, the Straits Forum has always adhered to its grassroots nature and become the largest and most comprehensive mechanism for people-to-people exchanges between the two sides of the Strait.
The 2024 forum, with the theme of expanding people-to-people exchanges and deepening integration and development, has attracted approximately 7,000 participants from the island, including representatives from political parties, industries, and social organizations.
The vibrant scenes of dialogues, exchanges, and interactions during the forum fully reflect the mainstream public opinion across the Strait, which advocates for peace, development, communication, and cooperation.
Fujian, the host province of the Straits Forum, is the ancestral home of many people in Taiwan and is at the forefront of cross-Strait exchanges and integration.
In September 2023, China released a policy document to support Fujian in piloting cross-Strait integrated development to a higher level. Over the past year, relevant departments have issued a series of supporting measures, and Fujian Province has also formulated implementation guidelines to promote exchanges between people from Fujian and Taiwan, facilitate the work and life of Taiwan compatriots in Fujian, and support Taiwan-funded enterprises.
These targeted practical measures have produced tangible results and also given people more confidence and certainty. At this year's forum, the organizers are expected to announce a new set of measures to provide more convenience to Taiwan compatriots.
In sharp contrast to the mainland's continuous provision of certainty is the escalating ""decoupling"" plot of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in Taiwan.
Since coming to power in May 2016, the DPP authorities have done everything possible to obstruct and limit cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation. After the announcement of hosting the 2024 Straits Forum, the DPP authorities tried to block Taiwan compatriots from participating in the forum activities on the mainland.
No matter how hard the DPP authorities try to set up obstacles and make threats, they cannot sever the deep-rooted kinship between the two sides of the Strait or sabotage the growing trend of cross-Strait exchanges and integration.
It should be understood that compatriots on both sides of the Strait are always one family, and it is natural for them to meet in family gatherings such as the Straits Forum.

People.cn,"Zhang Wenjie, Hongyu",Politics,20240615,1035,,,Straits Forum sees steady grassroots exchanges despite erratic cross-Strait relations,"BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Straits Forum, which advocates inclusive and grassroots cross-Strait exchanges, is entering its 16th year with strong vitality despite the ups and downs of relations between the Chinese mainland and the Taiwan region.
This year, the main conference is scheduled to commence on Saturday at the forum's primary venue in the coastal city of Xiamen, east China's Fujian Province. Approximately 50 events will be held across various cities in the province, which is situated just across the Strait from Taiwan.
About 7,000 people from diverse backgrounds in Taiwan are expected to participate in the forum, including representatives of political parties, event co-sponsors, professionals in various industries, leaders of social organizations and members of religious circles.
The first Straits Forum was held in 2009, a year that witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cross-Strait relations. That year, the regular consultation mechanism between the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) began to take shape, with six agreements signed.
In the same year, mainland companies began formally investing in Taiwan, and regular air services between the two sides were launched. Thus direct cross-Strait mail, transport and trade links were established in full.
With booming economic cooperation and frequent interactions between authorities on both sides, the need of a smooth channel for people-to-people exchanges gave birth to the Straits Forum. Nearly 10,000 people attended the inaugural event, over 8,000 of whom were from Taiwan.
But the rosy days of cross-Strait exchanges drew to a close when the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took office in Taiwan in 2016.
The DPP authorities rejected the 1992 Consensus -- a common political foundation for cross-Strait dialogue, and the ARATS-SEF consultation mechanism was suspended. Tensions and confrontations have since risen due to the DPP's separatist attempts for ""Taiwan independence.""
Despite this altered political backdrop, the Straits Forum has persisted. More than 330,000 people from the mainland and Taiwan attended the forum over the last 15 years. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands were able to take part in forum events online or in person.
Past forums have seen young people seeking career opportunities, martial arts enthusiasts exchanging training tips, disabled people sharing their personal stories, community workers meeting with their counterparts across the Strait and followers of various religions holding discussions.
At these forums, a total of 139 preferential policies to boost cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation were announced, covering areas from air services and travel permits to employment and investment.
""The Straits Forum is like a carnival for people across the Strait. We sit down, chat and bring our hearts closer to each other,"" said Wu Chia-ying, vice president of the Association of Taiwan Investment Enterprises on the Mainland. ""It is an annual rendezvous that we are very much looking for.""

China's pursuit of Chinese modernization through high-quality development will bring greater opportunities to the world, and building a community with a shared future for mankind will foster a brighter future for all, experts have said.
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday delivered a video speech to the opening ceremony of the celebration for the 60th anniversary of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), calling for fostering an international environment for peaceful development, following the trend toward open development, and promoting innovation-driven development, a message that resonated with the international community.
China's pursuit of Chinese modernization through high-quality development will bring greater opportunities to the world, and building a community with a shared future for mankind will foster a brighter future for all, experts have said.
STANDING FIRMLY WITH GLOBAL SOUTH
In his video speech, Xi said China will always be a member of the Global South and the developing world, adding that China will actively seek to import more from other developing countries, step up cooperation in trade, investment and development, and help implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The Global South has accounted for an increasing share of the world economy, and a significant portion of emerging markets and developing countries have embarked on the fast track of development, which has greatly promoted the process of world multipolarity.
The Global Development Initiative put forward by Xi has received positive responses from more than 100 countries and international organizations. The Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund established by China has supported the implementation of more than 200 projects.
Holding humanity's future and people's well-being close to its heart, China will work together with all parties to give the world a bright future of peace, security, prosperity and progress, Xi noted.
Talat Shabbir, director of the Islamabad-based China-Pakistan Study Centre at the Institute of Strategic Studies, said that Xi's call for universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization provides countries across the globe with the opportunity to benefit from free trade and utilize their economic capacities to contribute to the global economy.
For developing countries, this means not only increased access to global supply chains but also opportunities to be part of the supply chains, Shabbir noted.
""These opportunities have also led Pakistan to develop special economic zones and increase the country's capacity for renewable energy in the overall energy mix,"" he added.
China's opening up to the world is expanding. Through expos such as the China International Import Expo, the China International Fair for Trade in Services, and the Global Digital Trade Expo, an increasing number of products from Global South countries are entering the Chinese market, sharing opportunities and benefits from China's high-quality development.
Paul Frimpong, executive director of the Africa-China Center for Policy and Advisory, a think tank based in Ghana, said that Xi's address to the UNCTAD has sent a clear message to the world that China has always stood firmly with the Global South.
""China itself is part of developing countries and familiar with the challenges that developing countries are facing in terms of trade-related restrictions in the global arena, and I think Xi's speech has provided us with important ideas about dealing with global challenges including the imbalanced development,"" said Frimpong.
He noted that over the past years, the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China has led to profound improvements in economic and social development of the African continent, which highlighted the vital role China has played in advancing globalization.

PURSUING TRUE MULTILATERALISM
In his video speech, Xi said that all countries, major ones in particular, should pursue true multilateralism, advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world, abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and support a more effective role of UNCTAD and other multilateral agencies.
""I welcome the increased support of China to UNCTAD, and also the reaffirmation by President Xi Jinping, his commitment to multilateralism and to the work of United Nations,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told Xinhua on Wednesday.
""I was very impressed,"" said Rebeca Grynspan, secretary-general of UNCTAD. ""This is a testament to our good relationship, a longtime relationship, between China and UNCTAD. President Xi's support for UNCTAD really means a lot to us.""
""President Xi's message shows his very strong support for multilateralism and international cooperation. These are really two key elements for sustainable development and for peaceful development for the whole world,"" Grynspan added.
To practice true multilateralism and adhere to a global governance vision that emphasizes extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, means that global affairs must be discussed by all, governance systems built by all, and benefits of governance shared by all, so that every country is a participant, contributor and beneficiary of world peace and development.
In recent years, China has supported and practiced multilateralism with concrete actions. It has promoted high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, actively participated in the construction of multilateral cooperation platforms such as the BRICS Cooperation Mechanism and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and constantly enriched and improved the connotation of multilateralism, said Bambang Suryono, chairman of Asia Innovation Study Center, an Indonesian think tank.
In the past 60 years since the establishment of the UNCTAD, humanity has made significant progress. However, challenges such as climate change and deglobalization have posed threats to the effective functioning of multilateral institutions. China promotes ""functional and genuine multilateralism, where every country can pursue its right to development as enshrined in the founding UN Charter,"" said Adhere Cavince, a Kenya-based international relations scholar.

CHINESE WISDOM AND CHINESE SOLUTIONS
In his video speech, Xi said that it is important to build an open, inclusive and non-discriminatory environment for the digital economy, follow the people-centered, AI-for-good principle and strengthen AI-related rules and governance within the framework of the United Nations, actively advance green transition, and help developing countries join the trend of digital, smart and green development.
Grynspan said that Xi's message was ""so important,"" adding that the calls for inclusive development, for green development, and for a more equitable world are ""very strong messages that we absolutely share and thinking about UNCTAD.""
Electric vehicles, solar batteries and lithium-ion batteries, categorized as China's tech-intensive and green ""new three,"" reported a combined export value of 1.06 trillion yuan (150 billion dollars) in 2023, jumping 29.9 percent year on year.
Wichai Kinchong Choi, senior vice president of leading Thai bank Kasikornbank, said China's electric vehicles have gained popularity in Thailand and the country has introduced a wide array of new energy technologies and products from China, which has promoted its green transformation.
""Chinese technology would be conducive to accelerating the energy transition for developing countries, providing Chinese wisdom and solutions to solve the common problems faced by mankind,"" he said.
Calling Chinese modernization and high-quality development ""forward looking,"" Iqbal Surve, chairman of South Africa's Independent Media, said that China's focus on leveraging new technologies aligns with the global trends towards digitalization and sustainability.
Sri Lankan international affairs expert Yasiru Ranaraja said that Chinese modernization provides valuable experience for developing countries including Sri Lanka, adding that China advocates the concept of win-win cooperation and is committed to achieving common prosperity, which conforms to the critical needs of the majority of developing countries.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Politics,20240613,956,,,Xi emphasizes improving modern corporate system with Chinese characteristics,"BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, Chinese president, also chairman of the Central Military Commission, presided over the fifth meeting of the Central Commission for Deepening Overall Reform (CCDOR) on the afternoon of June 11. He is also director of the commission. Several documents were reviewed and adopted at the meeting. They are Guidelines on Improving the Modern Corporate System with Chinese Characteristics, Guidelines on Establishing a Sound Mechanism for Ensuring Benefits of Grain-Growers and a Compensation Mechanism for Major Grain-Producing Areas, and Guidelines on Building an Open Environment for Scientific and Technological Innovation with Global Competitiveness.
While presiding over the meeting, Xi stressed that to improve the modern corporate system with Chinese characteristics, it is imperative to give play to the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strengthen the leadership of the CPC, and improve corporate governance. It is also imperative to promote enterprises to establish and improve a modern corporate system, under which property ownership as well as rights and obligations are clearly defined, and the functions of the government and enterprises are separated. Such a system should be managed in a scientific manner so as to foster more world-class enterprises. To secure steady grain production and ensure food security, it is imperative to protect and motivate farmers to grow grain and spur local governments' enthusiasm for boosting grain production, and improve the mechanism for ensuring farmers' income and the compensation mechanism for major grain-producing areas. Policies must be more targeted and effective, so as to consolidate the foundation of food security.
Xi stressed the importance of driving innovation with further opening up, perfecting the system and mechanism for opening up in the science and technology sector, and improving the globally-oriented innovation system to actively integrate into the global innovation network. Importance should be attached to key areas and critical links to address deficiencies in the institution for opening up and innovation.
Li Qiang, Wang Huning, and Cai Qi attended the meeting. They are all members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and deputy directors of the CCDOR.
It was noted at the meeting that to improve the modern corporate system with Chinese characteristics, it is imperative to respect the status of enterprises as major players in business activities, adhere to a problem-oriented approach, and give them more guidance by adopting differentiated policies in accordance with their size, stage of development, and ownership. It is imperative to strengthen the Party's overall leadership over state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and optimize the related systems and mechanisms, so as to spur SOEs to strictly assume their responsibilities, improve the modern corporate governance of SOEs and further strengthen the supervision and management over state-owned capital. Efforts should be made to encourage and support eligible private enterprises to establish a modern corporate system, improve their corporate governance structure, regulate shareholders' behavior, strengthen internal supervision, and optimize the mechanism for risk prevention and control. It is essential to give full play to the leading role of Party building in strengthening internal management of private enterprises.
It was stressed at the meeting that to optimize the mechanisms for ensuring the incomes of grain growers and for compensating major grain-producing areas, it is imperative to place the boosting of overall agricultural production capacity in a more prominent position, improve policies related to pricing, subsidies and insurance, and explore new ways of improving the effectiveness of grain business. To better support and protect grain production, it is essential to refine the mechanisms for motivating main grain-producing areas by providing government rewards and subsidies, and explore multiple channels to compensate grain production and consumption areas. Concrete steps should be taken to build mechanisms for compensation between provincial-level regions to ensure that major grain-producing areas, major grain-consuming areas and areas where agricultural production and consumption are balanced all assume their responsibilities for safeguarding food security. Efforts should be coordinated to support small household farmers and new types of agricultural business entities, and step up policy support, service guidance and the expansion of common interests. Efforts should also be made to link small household farmers with modern agricultural development.
It was noted at the meeting that the strategies of ""going global"" and ""bringing in"" should be combined in order to create an open and globally-competitive environment for scientific and technological innovation. It is also necessary to expand international scientific and technological exchanges, strive to establish partnerships of cooperation and mutual benefits, as well as plan ahead and get deeply involved in global science and technology governance. It is essential to strengthen the building of an internationalized environment for scientific research, focus on practical concerns of scientific researchers, solve prominent problems for them, and ensure that talents will be introduced, be able to stay and apply their expertise to the utmost. Efforts should be made to improve the science and technology security system and risk prevention mechanism so that the line for security will never be crossed in an open environment.
Members of the CCDOR attended the meeting. Leading officials from relevant central Party and state departments sat in on the meeting.

The move harbors a hidden agenda of seeking ""Taiwan independence,"" said Chen Binhua, spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, noting that this approach will not succeed.
Chen made the remarks at a press conference in response to a media query regarding expectations by Taiwan's mainland affairs council to resolve issues related to the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) through the WTO mechanism.
""The 1992 Consensus is the political foundation for cross-Strait consultation, and 23 cross-Strait agreements, including the ECFA, have been signed on the common political basis of the 1992 Consensus,"" Chen said.
The two sides of the Taiwan Strait signed the ECFA to promote cross-Strait trade liberalization, which should have been carried out based on the normalization of cross-Strait trade, Chen noted.
However, considering that both sides belong to the same family, the mainland agreed to advance trade normalization and liberalization simultaneously and implement the ""early harvest program"" of the ECFA, despite the abnormal and discriminatory situation in which the Taiwan authorities continue to restrict the entry of over 2,000 agricultural and industrial products from the mainland, Chen added.
Besides, in light of the economic conditions of both sides, the mainland did not require equal quantities or trade volumes of products during the implementation of the ""early harvest program,"" he said.
Chen noted that such a favorable agreement, which unilaterally benefits Taiwan, would not have been possible if everything had been in line with WTO rules.

Sun told media after the meetings that the participants exchanged views on such issues as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Ukraine crisis, the Korean Peninsula, Myanmar, climate change, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
The Chinese side elaborated its principled positions on relevant issues and sternly refuted fallacies of the United States and the West concerning China, Sun said.
He said that ASEAN, China, Japan and ROK positively evaluated progress in the implementation of the 10+3 cooperation work plan (2023-2027), were supportive of deepening cooperation in finance, food security, electric vehicles, digital economy, green economy, society and culture, as well as high-quality implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and enhancement of regional supply chain connectivity.
All sides generally support the role of the East Asia Summit in promoting political security and economic development, boosting constructive dialogues and exchanges, and expanding cooperation in emerging fields, Sun said.
He added that the forum is the most important platform for multilateral security dialogue and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, and members emphasized the need to continue to promote confidence-building measures, deepen practical cooperation, and steadily carry out preventive diplomacy, contributing to lasting peace in the region.
He went on to say that at the meetings, China emphasized the Asia-Pacific was pacesetter of peaceful development, and supported the centrality of ASEAN, supported ASEAN's approach to regional security cooperation, supported the settlement of differences and disputes by peaceful means, and called for the establishment of security concept of equality and cooperation.
The Chinese side reiterated that it adheres to the principles of consensus and accommodating the comfort level of all parties, enriches the topics of cooperation, and actively responds to emerging challenges such as cybersecurity, climate change and artificial intelligence, so as to safeguard common security interests, Sun said.
China clearly supports an ASEAN-centered regional security architecture, adheres to the concept of openness and win-win cooperation, takes into account the demands of all parties, accommodates the interests of all parties, and builds a balanced, effective and sustainable regional security architecture, instead of starting things anew and creating a closed and exclusive club, the Chinese diplomat said.
On the South China Sea issue, he said that the biggest security challenge in the South China Sea comes from outside the region, and external forces led by the United States, for geopolitical purposes, have manipulated bloc politics and confrontation of camps, pushed forward military deployments and operations in the South China Sea, instigated the intensification of differences and contradictions related to the sea, and undermined the legitimate rights and interests of littoral countries.
Sun said China has indisputable sovereignty over islands in the South China Sea, and is committed to properly managing disputes through dialogue and consultation with countries concerned in the South China Sea in accordance with the ""dual-track"" approach.
China is also working with ASEAN countries to comprehensively and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), and actively pushing for new progress in consultations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, according to Sun.
With regard to the deployment of intermediate-range missile system by the United States in the region, Sun said that such a move has drawn the region into an arms race and placed the entire Asia-Pacific region under the shadow of geopolitical conflicts, seriously reversing the course of history, jeopardizing security of regional countries, and seriously undermining regional peace and stability.
He said that China firmly opposes Cold War mentality and confrontation of camps, ignition of an arms race in the region by any external forces, and use of regional countries as tools of hegemony and geostrategic pawns.

BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Braving the scorching summer sun, Liu Hongyan, 44, wearing an orange vest and carrying a litter picker, treks through waist-high bushes across rugged terrain for about 20 minutes to reach her destination: a 10-km stretch of the Great Wall.
Liu and her fellow villagers in Shixia Village, located at the foot of the iconic Badaling section of the Great Wall, are among thousands of Great Wall rangers across the country dedicated to protecting this UNESCO World Heritage Site.
They pick up trash along the Great Wall and inspect bricks for cracks caused by weathering or damage from human activities.
Recently, Liu and her fellow villagers wrote to Chinese President Xi Jinping, telling what they had done to protect the Great Wall and the changes taking place in their village.
In his reply, Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, said he was pleased to learn about the villagers' commitment over the years to protecting the Great Wall, passing on the Great Wall culture, and leveraging its resources on their way to prosperity.
Protecting the Great Wall is a long tradition in Shixia. The baton of Great Wall protection was passed on to Liu from her 80-year-old uncle, who had devoted himself to the cause as a volunteer since four decades ago.
The Great Wall is the largest-scale existing cultural heritage in China, consisting of walls scattered across 15 provincial-level regions, with some sections dating back 2,000 years.
In China, safeguarding the Great Wall is a collective responsibility that spans from the top leadership to citizens at the grassroots level.
""When people mention China, they think of the Great Wall, and when they talk about Chinese civilization, they also think of the Great Wall,"" Xi once said.
It embodies the great resilience of the Chinese nation, which is united as one, like a fortress, and ceaselessly pursues self-improvement, he added.
Since assuming the Party's top office in late 2012, Xi has paid close attention to activities that celebrate and protect the cultural value of the Great Wall, and issued multiple instructions to guide the establishment of a Great Wall national cultural park.
In 2019, a plan to build the cultural park was approved at a leadership meeting chaired by Xi.
During an inspection tour to the northwestern province of Gansu in the same year, Xi visited the Jiayu Pass, the starting point of a Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) section of the Great Wall.
He ascended to the rostrum of the pass to view the layout and terrain of the fortress, which underwent a major renovation in previous years. ""We must salute efforts to keep our history and culture alive and strong and strive to preserve our roots for a prospering Chinese spirit,"" Xi said.
Over the years, new progress has been made in the conservation of the Great Wall. In Beijing, an all-encompassing system that includes regular repair, emergency reinforcement, preventive measures and daily maintenance has been established.
In addition, high-tech means, such as drones and satellite images, have played an important role in discovering damage with greater speed and accuracy.
For the Great Wall rangers, their endeavors in preserving this iconic cultural heritage also benefit them and fellow villagers.
Leveraging its resources related to Great Wall culture, Shixia Village, like many other villages nestled near the wall, has transformed into a popular destination for rural tourism with homestay and restaurants.
In his letter to villagers in Shixia, Xi expressed the hope that they will continue to protect the Great Wall with the same dedication as they protect their own homes. He emphasized the importance of passing on this precious heritage to future generations.
""We will double down on our efforts to protect the Great Wall, promote its culture and better tell its captivating story as required by General Secretary Xi,"" said Liu, the villager.

Children perform dragon dance to greet the upcoming International Children's Day at a kindergarten in Wenling City, east China's Zhejiang Province, May 30, 2024. (Photo by Zhou Xuejun/Xinhua)
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- In May 2004, in the suburbs of Nanchong in southwest China's Sichuan Province, then-Party chief of the eastern Zhejiang Province Xi Jinping ceremoniously deposited a handful of soil onto a cornerstone, marking the inception of a construction project.
This land was subsequently transformed into Zhijiang Primary School through collaborative efforts and ""paired-up assistance"" from Zhejiang. The school was named after a major river in Zhejiang to remember the latter's help.
Two decades later, Xi, now Chinese president and general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, still cherishes a strong affection for the school.
Recently, a fifth-grade class from the school wrote a letter to Xi, sharing details about their studies and daily lives while expressing their gratitude. They quickly got a reply from the top Chinese leader.
In a letter dated May 30, two days ahead of the International Children's Day, Xi said he was delighted to hear that the school is doing very well and the students are thriving. He encouraged the students to ""become the talent capable of shouldering the mission of building a strong country and realizing national rejuvenation.""
The bond between Xi and the pupils serves as a prime example of the benefits derived from China's implementation of ""paired-up assistance"" between its eastern and western regions. This practice, first introduced in the 1990s, is a distinctive approach aimed at promoting fair and balanced development across various sectors, including education.
Xi has always attached great importance to ensuring equal access to quality education for every child. ""Education equity is a crucial cornerstone of social fairness,"" he said.
When inspecting the once poverty-stricken hinterland of Daliang Mountains in Sichuan in 2018, Xi asked in detail about children's education in the village. ""In terms of education, don't let children fail at the starting line,"" he said.
In 2019, he took a long journey to a remote mountainous place in Chongqing, which had previously been plagued by poverty. The first stop of his visit was a primary school nestled deep in the mountains.
""No matter how difficult the circumstances, we must not let the children suffer, and no matter how impoverished, we must not deprive them of education,"" Xi said, stressing that efforts must be made to ensure children in impoverished mountainous regions have access to education and enjoy a joyous childhood.
Xi believes that children's health and all-round development are no trivial matter.
In addition to academic scores, he has on many occasions called for greater efforts to build up children's physical strength through sports and exercise.
He had visited the cafeterias of schools to learn about whether children, particularly those in impoverished areas, have nutritious and healthy lunches.
Noticing a high rate of nearsightedness among young students, Xi demanded efforts from the whole society to guarantee a ""bright future"" for children. ""When the young people are strong, the country will be strong,"" he noted.
Despite a very tight schedule every day, Xi has always managed to find time to talk to children, visit schools, participate in children-focused events, and respond to letters from the children. His concern for children has been reflected in various policies and initiatives implemented by the top authorities.
In June 2023, the general offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council jointly issued a guideline on establishing a sound and balanced basic public education service system, highlighting consistent financial input to make sure basic public education covers all.
About two months later, an action plan was released for expanding fine elementary education resources and improving the quality of elementary education. It was also written into the government work report delivered at the annual session of the National People's Congress in March this year.
China boasts the world's largest education system and has ascended to the ranks of upper-middle-level countries in terms of the overall modernization of education.
While inspecting a school in Beijing last year, Xi said that his generation is working hard for the goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects by the middle of this century.
""It will be up to you to carry on the mission in the future,"" he told the students.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Politics,20240531,835,,,Xi Story: An inspirer for sci-tech workers,"BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- British chemist David Evans cherishes a necktie adorned with Chinese characters representing chemical elements. The distinctive accessory not only reveals his passion for science but often reminds him of the moment when he met Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Four years ago, at a Spring Festival reception in Beijing, the Chinese president noticed Evans' tie while shaking hands with him. Xi said to Evans, ""I can guess your profession. We could have been fellows, (because) I studied chemical engineering (at university).""
Evans, a professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology, was pleasantly surprised to learn of the Chinese president's academic background at Tsinghua University in the 1970s.
But what amazed him even more was Xi's speech at a symposium attended by scientists in September 2020, in which a lot of scientific knowledge, principles, and historical facts were cited.
""I have rarely seen a state leader having such an ability to engage in an in-depth discussion of scientific logic and laws,"" said Evans.
Noting that the key to Chinese modernization lies in science and technology, Xi has shown a keen interest in frontier areas. He is no stranger to the world of cutting-edge advancements, and concepts like AI, quantum, and self-driving technology dot his speeches. During his inspection visits nationwide, he has visited research institutions and sci-tech enterprises, and is often seen checking out the latest gadgets at tech exhibitions.
He also has deep respect for heroes behind the country's numerous sci-tech breakthroughs.
While presenting top national awards to wheelchair-bound scientists, or hosting video calls with orbiting taikonauts, he expresses care for the people at the forefront of the nation's innovation.
Before the launch of the Shenzhou-10 manned spaceship in 2013, Xi requested that sticky rice dumplings be added to the spaceship pantry so that the orbiting crew could celebrate Dragon Boat Festival in space, like what they do at home on Earth.
In addition to ensuring that all contributions are acknowledged and celebrated, Xi has made it his mission to alleviate the burdens of scientists and engineers and address any problems they face.
In May 2021, when addressing a meeting of academicians and sci-tech worker representatives, he highlighted the efforts on management reform in the sci-tech field, such as freeing sci-tech workers from formalistic and bureaucratic activities and abolishing the outdated evaluation criteria for talent that solely focused on papers, certificates or awards. Instead, he proposed a new evaluation system that was based on innovation, ability and contribution.
Recognizing the financial pressure that they often face, he advocated granting scientists greater decision-making power over technical routes and the use of funds.
Sci-tech workers, who celebrate the eighth National Science and Technology Workers' Day on May 30, have benefited from improved working conditions and increased government support as they strive for innovation.
Over the past decade, China has seen a significant boost in funding for research and development, which rose from 1 trillion yuan (about 140 billion U.S. dollars) in 2012 to 3.09 trillion yuan in 2022. As an important indicator measuring sci-tech manpower input, the number of full-time equivalent R&D personnel in China increased from 3.247 million in 2012 to 6.354 million in 2022.
Xi has also paid particular attention to foreign scientists, especially those from developing countries, who are committed to sci-tech exchanges and cooperation with China.
Last year, he replied to a letter from renowned Cuban scientist Pedro A. Valdes-Sosa, whose team in China chalked up great progress in brain science research and China-Cuba neurotechnology cooperation.
Xi expressed the hope that China-Cuba cooperation in various fields including science and technology could continue in the new era and better benefit the people of the two countries.
The Chinese president's encouragement for international sci-tech collaboration is reflected in many initiatives. China's top science awards are now open to foreign candidates; the Belt and Road Initiative has supported thousands of young foreign scientists to engage in scientific research and academic exchanges in China; and the country's space missions are made available for foreign scientific research payloads.
""We are striving to extend the benefits of scientific and technological innovation to more countries and people,"" Xi once said.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Politics,20240530,925,,,Xi urges promotion of high-quality and sufficient employment,"BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held its 14th group study session on the afternoon of May 27. The topic is about promoting high-quality and sufficient employment. Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the session. He said that promoting high-quality and sufficient employment is the new orientation and mission of the employment work on the new journey in the new era. Xi urged the need to adhere to people-centered development philosophy, and fully implement the guiding principle that people seek jobs on their own, market adjusts employment and the government promotes employment and encourages starting businesses. Efforts are urged to continuously improve the quality of employment and expand its quantity within a reasonable range, so as to constantly enhance the sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security among workers. In doing this, it would help provide strong support for promoting the building of a strong country in all respects through a Chinese path to modernization, and the realization of national rejuvenation.
Mo Rong, head of the Chinese Academy of Labor and Social Security, gave a lecture on the high-quality and sufficient employment issue at the study session and put forth suggestions. Comrades of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee listened attentively and had discussions afterwards.
Xi delivered an important speech after listening to the lecture and discussions. He pointed out that employment is the most basic part of the people's livelihood, which is related to the people's immediate interests, the country's healthy economic and social development, and its long-term stability. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee has always placed employment work in a prominent position when it comes to the governance of the country, strengthened employment-first policies, and enhanced employment promotion mechanisms to effectively deal with various pressures and challenges. As a result, an average of 13 million new urban jobs were created annually, providing important support for improving people's livelihood and economic development. In practice, the CPC Central Committee has continuously deepened the understanding of the way the employment work should be done in the new era and accumulated a lot of experience. It mainly includes insisting on taking employment as the basic part of people's livelihood, implementing the employment-first strategy, promoting employment through development, combining expanding employment with improving its quality, focusing on the employment of key groups, encouraging starting businesses to create jobs, creating a fair employment environment, and adhering to building harmonious labor relations. Such practices are highly precious, and we should continue to build on them.
Xi underlined the need to unswervingly implement new development philosophy while taking high-quality and sufficient employment as a priority goal of economic and social development in a more conscious manner, so as to make high-quality development a process of expanding employment and improving its quality, and thus increase the capacity of development to create jobs. Xi said that with focus on developing new quality productive forces in light of local conditions, it is important to transform and upgrade traditional industries, foster and strengthen emerging industries, plan for the layout of future industries, improve the modern industrial system, and strive to create more high-quality jobs. He also noted that efforts are required to support the development of industries and enterprises that can create more jobs, and secure the steady expansion of employment. In light of the new trends in economic and social development and the people's new expectations for higher quality of life, Xi stressed the importance of vigorously developing new forms and models of businesses, actively exploring and cultivating new job categories, and developing new employment growth points. It is imperative to step up the assessment of the impact of major policies, major projects and distribution of major productive forces on employment, promote the coordination between employment policies and policies concerning fiscal, monetary, investment, consumption, industry and regional development, so as to make them work in the same direction and provide an employment-friendly approach.
Xi pointed out that to address the structural employment problems of imbalance between human resources supply and demand, efforts should be made to speed up the development of modern human resources with good quality, sufficient quantity, optimized structure and reasonable distribution. It is imperative to adapt to a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and make proper judgments in advance on the trends of human resources development. It is essential to coordinate education, training and employment, make dynamic adjustment to disciplines and resources for higher education, vigorously develop vocational education, and improve the system of lifelong vocational training. The mechanism of supply and demand should be optimized so as to place right talent in right positions, put people in jobs where their expertise can best apply, make it possible for all to give full play to their talent, and improve the quality and stability of employment. Intensive public awareness activities should be organized to guide the whole society to foster a correct outlook on employment, and open up new horizons in employment through a new thinking in seeking jobs. Efforts should be made to analyze why some industries face a labor shortage, and the situation that many job seekers are unable to land a job should be addressed by finding out why there are job vacancies in some industries.
Xi stressed that policies for providing employment support for key groups should be refined. Top priority should be given to the employment of young people including college graduates, and more jobs should be created for them to apply what they have learned and what they are adept at. Young people should be encouraged to find jobs or start businesses in key fields, key industries, primary-level institutions in urban and rural areas and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and market-oriented and social channels should be expanded for young people to find a job. It is imperative to coordinate efforts to promote new urbanization and advance rural revitalization across the board, attach equal importance to finding jobs outside hometowns and finding jobs near hometowns, take multiple steps to boost employment for migrant workers, and guide those leaving homes to work elsewhere to come back and talents from urban areas to go to rural areas to start their own businesses. It is imperative to stabilize the employment scale and income of those lifted out of poverty and see that no large number of people become poverty-stricken again due to unemployment. It is also necessary to redouble assistance to those groups who have difficulty finding employment due to old age, disability, and long-term unemployment, utilize public service positions in a coordinated manner, and secure jobs for zero-employment households. Efforts must also be made to ensure the employment of such groups as ex-service personnel and women.
Xi noted the necessity of deepening reform in employment systems and mechanisms. It is imperative to improve public services for employment and optimize public service system for employment. Efforts should also be made to improve the supportive mechanism for driving employment by entrepreneurship, optimize services for starting businesses, and boost the quality of business startups. It is also important to improve the unified and standard human resources market and create a fair and just employment environment, so as to allow everyone the opportunity to achieve self-development through hard work.
Xi stressed the need for strengthening protection of workers' rights and interests. Efforts should be made to improve labor laws and regulations, regularize labor standards for new employment forms, and optimize social security, so as to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of workers. It is imperative to further protect the rights and interests of workers involved in flexible employment and new forms of employment, expand pilot projects for work-related injury insurance, sum up experience in a timely manner and formulate institutions in this regard. Market regulation as well as oversight and law enforcement on labor security should be strengthened, and employment discrimination, wages and payments for social insurance in arrears, illegal layoffs and other problems should be effectively addressed.
Lastly, Xi pointed out that Party committees and governments at all levels should regard employment as a top priority for people's livelihood, strengthen organizational leadership, improve institutions and mechanisms, and enhance work synergy. It is necessary to accelerate the building of China's theoretical system on employment and effectively increase China's voice and influence in the field of employment on the global stage.

Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks in a new instruction on work related to rural roads.
In recent years, the Ministry of Transport and other central and local authorities have made notable achievements in improving rural roads, boosting the sense of fulfillment, happiness and security of rural residents, Xi said.
Better rural roads will provide solid support to bring common prosperity to rural residents, facilitate rural revitalization, and accelerate the modernization of China's agriculture and countryside, Xi said.
Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng conveyed Xi's instruction on Wednesday at a conference on building high-quality rural roads held in Shaoxing, east China's Zhejiang Province.
Ten years ago, Xi issued instructions on rural road construction to eliminate the traffic bottlenecks restricting rural development, and to facilitate poverty alleviation work in the countryside.
He ordered that rural roads be built well, managed well, maintained well and used well. For this reason, these roads have become known as ""Four-Wells Rural Roads,"" or ""Sihaonongcunlu"" in Chinese.
Official statistics show that these roads have played a fundamental role in improving livelihoods in China's vast countryside.
From 2014 to 2023, a total of 2.5 million kilometers of rural roads were built or renovated, and 70,600 villages were connected by paved roads. By the end of 2023, the aggregate length of China's rural roads stood at 4.6 million kilometers.

Zhu Fenglian, a State Council Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson, made the remarks in response to a media query at a routine news conference.
The DPP authorities claim to desire peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, but in reality, they adhere to a ""Taiwan independence"" stance, incite cross-Strait confrontation, and advance their goal by increasingly banking on external forces and through military means, in an attempt to split Taiwan from China, said the spokesperson.
This can in no way be considered the behavior of so-called pilots for peace, said Zhu. ""Rather, this is clearly the behavior of instigators of war,"" she added.
Lai Ching-te portrayed the DPP-ruled Taiwan as a pilot for peace, claiming to maintain the status quo across the Strait in his debut speech as Taiwan's new leader on May 20.
The mainland spokesperson reiterated that although the two sides of the Strait have not yet reunified, the fact that the mainland and Taiwan both belong to one China, and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, has never changed and cannot be changed.
""Taiwan independence"" goes against peace in the Taiwan Strait, and it is the biggest source of chaos that leads to military conflicts, damages to the interests of the people, and turbulence in the Strait, Zhu said.
She called on people in Taiwan to recognize the harm and destructiveness of the DPP's independence agenda, oppose secessionist activities and external interference, and help with the return of cross-Strait relations to peaceful development.
This, she said, would safeguard peace and stability in the Strait, and also the security and well-being of the people of Taiwan.

Calling Chiang a leader of the anti-colonialism movement during the period when Japan exercised colonial rule over Taiwan, Zhu said the purpose of Chiang was to resist Japanese colonial rule and fight for the freedom of the Chinese nation. Chiang also said that the Taiwanese are clearly Chinese.
With the purpose of whitewashing the vicious motives of soliciting external support for their independence agenda, the manipulation of Chiang's words by people like Lai is a betrayal of the spirit of the Chinese nation and disrespectful to Chiang, Zhu said.
Zhu also slammed Lai and his ilk for using Taiwan's misery of being colonized by the Netherlands as a tool to promote ""Taiwan independence.""

People.cn,"Tian Yi, Liang Jun",Politics,20240529,824,,,Xi calls for promoting quality and quantity of new jobs,"Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, has called for sustained efforts to promote high-quality and sufficient employment to keep enhancing the sense of gain, happiness and security among the vast majority of workers.
While presiding over a group study session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on Monday, Xi said that China's high-quality development should be a process of improving and expanding employment opportunities.
The policymakers at the meeting listened to a report made by Mo Rong, head of the Chinese Academy of Labor and Social Security, before sharing their views in the discussions.
The central government has outlined a target of creating over 12 million new jobs in urban areas this year while pledging to maintain the surveyed urban unemployment rate at around 5.5 percent. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the urban surveyed unemployment rate nationwide was 5.2 percent during the January-April period, down 0.2 percentage points compared with the same period last year.
Xi highlighted at the session the key experiences the Party's central leadership has drawn from job creation efforts, including seeing employment as the cornerstone for public well-being, adhering to an employment-first policy, prioritizing job creation for key groups and creating more jobs through encouraging entrepreneurship.
He reiterated the necessity to tailor the development of new quality productive forces to local conditions, transform and upgrade traditional industries, nurture and expand emerging sectors, and make plans for the overall development of emerging sectors.
The authorities must continue to support the growth of businesses and sectors with large potential for job creation in order to stabilize and expand the job market, he said.
In alignment with new trends and fresh expectations from the general public for a high-quality life, the development of new business models must be vigorously advanced, and new growth drivers in the job market must be cultivated, Xi stressed.
He underlined the need to accelerate efforts to develop modern human resources characterized by high quality, sufficient quantity, optimized structure and rational distribution, in order to address the structural imbalance between supply and demand in the job market.
The general secretary called for dynamic adjustments in the structure of higher education majors and resources, the vigorous development of vocational education, and improvements to the lifelong vocational skills training system.
It is important to analyze the reason for labor shortages in some sectors to solve the problem of unemployment by addressing the issue of recruitment difficulties facing businesses, he said.
With over 11.7 million students due to graduate from college this year, Xi called for continuous efforts to prioritize the employment of young people, such as college graduates, and develop more job opportunities conducive to their expertise.
Young people should be encouraged to find jobs and start businesses in key sectors, at the grassroots level and in small, medium-sized and micro businesses, he said.
As China moves forward with its new urbanization and rural vitalization drive, the nation must take multipronged measures to help migrant workers find jobs, while encouraging talent to return to rural areas and urban residents to start rural businesses.
The general secretary cautioned against a return to poverty on a large scale due to unemployment, saying that the overall number and income of migrant workers who have been lifted out of poverty must be stabilized.
Greater assistance must be extended to older workers, disabled individuals and the long-term jobless, and the authorities must take coordinated measures to ensure that all families can have sources of income to pay their bills.
The authorities must strive to establish a comprehensive and standardized human resources market system, creating a fair employment environment and ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to achieve personal development through hard work, Xi said.
To strengthen the protection of workers' rights and interests, it is necessary to improve labor laws and regulations, establish labor standards for new forms of employment and enhance the social security system, he added.
The authorities should effectively address issues such as employment discrimination, wage arrears, lack of employment insurance and illegal layoffs, he said.

The document, consisting of seven chapters and 52 articles, specifies various types of misconduct and corresponding penalties.
The regulation was adopted at a State Council executive meeting last month and will take effect on Sept. 1 this year.

Xi made the remarks on Monday while presiding over a group study session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
Xi said China must apply people-centered development philosophy, and improve both the quality and quantity of jobs through specific pro-employment policies.
Mo Rong, head of the Chinese Academy of Labor and Social Security, gave a lecture on the high-quality and sufficient employment issue at the study session and put forth relevant suggestions.
The attendees listened attentively to Mo and then made discussions.
Since the CPC's 18th National Congress was held in 2012, employment has been a priority for the Party leadership in the governance of the country, with 13 million urban jobs created each year on average.
Xi noted that employment is the most basic part of the people's well-being, which is connected with the people's immediate interests, and the country's sound economic and social development as well as its long-term peace and stability.
Valuable experience has been gained through practice, such as relying on development to promote employment, targeting key groups to increase employment, and driving employment through entrepreneurship, Xi said, calling for long-term implementation and continuous improvement of these practices.
This year, China aims to create over 12 million jobs in urban areas and keep the surveyed urban unemployment rate at about 5.5 percent. The country's surveyed urban unemployment rate came in at 5.2 percent in the January-April period.
Xi urged efforts to prioritize high-quality and sufficient employment as a primary goal of economic and social development, and further boost employment through development.
Measures should be taken to develop new quality productive forces according to local conditions as part of the efforts to create more high-quality jobs, he said.
The country should support the growth of industries and enterprises with strong job-creation capacities, and nurture new business forms and models to create more jobs.
Xi also called for the establishment of an employment-friendly development model by strengthening the assessment of the impact of major policies, projects, and the distribution of productive forces on employment, and making fiscal, monetary, investment, consumption, industrial and regional development policies more conducive to creating jobs.
Xi emphasized the need to address the supply-demand imbalance in the workforce which leads to structural unemployment.
Efforts should be focused on analyzing and assessing the workforce development trends, and accordingly adjust higher education majors and the distribution of resources, he said.
It is also imperative to boost vocational education and improve the country's lifelong vocational training system, Xi noted.
He called for efforts to find out the root causes of labor shortages in certain sectors in order to better meet employment market demands.
Xi specifically stressed improving employment support policies for college graduates and other young people. China is expected to see over 11.7 million college graduates this year.
Multiple measures should be taken to promote the employment of migrant workers, stabilize the number and income of people who were lifted out of poverty, and provide more help to groups that find it difficult to secure employment. Meanwhile, attention should also be paid to the employment of ex-service personnel and women.
Xi called for efforts to deepen reform of employment systems and mechanisms, and protect the rights and interests of workers, and urged Party committees and governments at all levels to give top priority to work related with employment.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Zhong Wenxing",Politics,20240528,1518,,,Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee holds meeting to review relevant documents,"BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held a meeting on May 27 and reviewed two documents, namely Policy Measures to Accelerate Development of Central China in the New Era, and Regulations on Accountability for Failing to Prevent or Defuse Financial Risks (trial). Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting.
It was noted at the meeting that it is a major strategic decision made by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core to promote the development of central China. It is imperative to thoroughly understand the strategic intent of the CPC Central Committee, and the significance of strengthening the strategic position of central China as an important base in terms of grain production, energy and raw materials, modern equipment manufacturing and high-tech industry, and also a comprehensive transportation hub, so as to advance all key tasks to make new major breakthroughs in promoting the development of central China.
The meeting underlined the need for the region to give full play to its concentrated science and education resources, adhere to innovation-driven development, and strengthen original science and technology research. The region was required to develop new quality productive forces in light of local conditions, accelerate the building of a modern industrial system, expand and strengthen the real economy, coordinate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, foster and strengthen emerging industries, and plan for the layout of future industries. While giving full play to its geographical advantages, the region should strengthen the construction of a modern transportation infrastructure system, and promote the efficient, free and convenient flow of factors so that the region will better integrate into serving the new development paradigm. Collaborative efforts are needed for the region to promote environmental protection and green and low-carbon development, and speed up the endeavors to build a beautiful central China.
It is imperative for the region to advance integrated urban-rural development and take solid steps to promote rural revitalization across the board. The region should attach importance to improving the capability to ensure the security of food, energy and resources, so as to realize mutual support between high-quality development and high-level security. The Central Leading Group for Coordinated Regional Development should strengthen the overall coordination to flesh out the content of all tasks, and push local efforts to fulfill the tasks by constantly checking the to-do list. Relevant departments should intensify their support, and provinces in central China including Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei and Hunan should bear their principal responsibilities and form synergy to write a new chapter in energizing the central region.
It was noted at the meeting that preventing and defusing financial risks bears heavily on the national security, the overall development and the safety of people's property, and it is the important work that must be done well in the process of achieving high-quality development. Formulating and introducing trial regulations concerning accountability for failing to prevent or defuse financial risks are aimed at further exercising full and rigorous Party self-governance in the financial sector. It is also meant to strengthen the centralized and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee over work in the financial sector, and to further make relevant administrative departments, financial institutions, competent departments in the sector, and local Party committees shoulder their responsibilities. With the new regulations, leading officials at all levels will be urged to have a correct understanding of what it means to perform well. They should make sure that various tasks in strengthening financial regulation across the board, preventing and defusing financial risks, and promoting high-quality development in the financial sector are fulfilled well.
It was noted at the meeting that a good job must be done in implementing the regulations. Rigor must be prioritized, specifications of the regulations must be enforced to the letter, and those violators must be held to account. The message must be brought home that those who fail to perform their duties will be held to account, and be severely punished. Financial oversight must have ""teeth and thorns"" and be sharp-pointed. Strict tone, measures and atmosphere must prevail in the financial sector forever.

People.cn,"Tian Yi, Liang Jun",Politics,20240528,925,,,Xiconomics in Practice: Xi chairs meeting that reviews provisions to defuse financial risks,"Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, presided over a meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on Monday, which deliberated on trial provisions concerning accountability for failing to prevent or defuse financial risks, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
The meeting released another strong signal that China will continue to step up efforts to prevent and defuse major risks in the financial industry, as the country moves swiftly to promote high-quality development and build itself into a global financial powerhouse, experts said.
Coming after a series of recent measures to tackle financial risks, the trial provisions for accountability will further improve institutional mechanisms to better prevent and resolve risks and promote the sound, high-quality development of the financial market, which plays a critical role in the overall economy, experts further noted.
Notably, the meeting stressed that preventing and defusing financial risks is related to national security, overall development, and the security of people's property. It is a major hurdle that must be overcome to achieve high-quality development, according to the meeting.
The trial provisions for accountability are also aimed at urging officials at all levels to establish a correct view of performance and better carry out various tasks of comprehensively strengthening financial supervision, preventing and defusing financial risks, and promoting high-quality financial development, the meeting noted, stressing strictness in implementing the trial provisions.
The meeting further underscored the top Chinese leadership's focus on tackling financial risks and promoting high-quality development in the financial industry, experts said.
""Tackling financial risks has become a top priority for the CPC Central Committee, and addressing loopholes and weak links is a continuous effort,"" Dong Shaopeng, a senior research fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Monday.
Dong said that since the second half of 2023, when the stock market faced serious downside risks, there have also been major risks in related areas such as financial markets, the property sector and local government debt, which demands strengthened regulation. ""In order to tackle weak links in our country's financial regulatory system, I think strengthened provisions on accountability are imperative.""
Monday's meeting came after a CPC Central Committee Political Bureau meeting on April 30 that also stressed continuously preventing and defusing risks in key areas. It demanded research on policies to reduce housing inventory and improve the quality of newly-added housing. The plan for local governments to resolve debt risks should be thoroughly implemented, ensuring that provinces, cities and counties with high debt risks not only effectively reduce their debt burden, but also maintain stable development, it said.
The tone-setting central financial work conference in October 2023 stressed the comprehensive strengthening of financial supervision, improving the financial system, optimizing financial services, and preventing and resolving risks. Then in March, the Government Work Report called for greater efforts to effectively prevent and resolve risks in key areas.
Xi attaches great importance to the financial industry. At the opening ceremony for a study session on promoting high-quality financial development in January, Xi noted that the path for financial development with Chinese characteristics not only follows the way for the development of modern finance, but also has distinctive features that suit China's national conditions, and thus it is different in nature from the mode of Western financial development.
""We should have more confidence and continue to explore and improve our work in the financial sector, so that this path will become wider and wider,"" Xi said, while stressing that risk prevention and control must be regarded as the abiding theme of financial work, according to Xinhua.
Continuous efforts
With the top leadership focused on building the country into a global financial powerhouse, greater policy measures and reforms are expected to be taken in the future, experts noted.
Preventing and defusing financial risks and deepening financial reforms are also expected to be on the agenda for the third plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, which is expected to take place in July and will primarily study issues concerning further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernization, according to experts.
Cao Yuanzheng, chief economist at Bank of China International, said that the trial provisions on accountability are just part of broader efforts to tackle financial risks and promote sound development, as outlined by the central financial work conference.
""Over the past four decades of reform and opening-up, China's financial industry has made great achievements, but we must also realize the importance of preventing and defusing financial risks, Cao told the Global Times on Monday, noting that trial provisions on accountability further improve the overall regulatory system, ""which is of great importance in preventing systemic financial risks.""
With continuous efforts by the top leadership as well as sound economic fundamentals, China's financial industry has great potential to become a global leader, experts noted.
""The real economy is very dynamic, which provides a solid foundation for high-quality development in the financial industry,"" Dong said, noting that a top priority for China's financial work is to make sure that the financial industry will serve the development of the real economy.
China has already built a massive financial industry, with more than 4,000 banking institutions in total and five lenders assessed as global systemically important banks. As of the end of 2023, total assets of financial institutions in China rose to 461.09 trillion yuan ($64.97 trillion), up 9.9 percent year-on-year, according to official data.
In addition to efforts to prevent and defuse financial risks and promote high-quality development, China is also moving steadily to further open up its financial markets to foreign businesses.
The central financial work conference in October 2023 also called for efforts to promote high-level financial opening-up. Specifically, the meeting urged the steady expansion of institutional opening-up in the financial sector, improvements in cross-border investment and financing facilitation, and attracting more foreign financial institutions and long-term capital to expand and conduct business in China.

It is important to make coordinated efforts in transforming and upgrading traditional sectors, fostering and building up emerging industries, and planning the development of future industries, said a summary of the meeting.
Modernizing the transportation infrastructure was deemed essential to facilitate the efficient and seamless flow of production factors and to enable the region to better integrate into the new development paradigm. The meeting called for coordinated efforts on environmental protection and ecological preservation, as well as green and low-carbon development, as part of broader efforts to construct a beautiful central region.
Moreover, the participants underscored the imperative of rural-urban integration and steadfast progress in the comprehensive vitalization of rural areas, calling for the region to bolster its capacity in ensuring food and energy resource security.
As for the prevention and defusing of financial risks, the meeting underlined work in this regard as essential to national security, the nation's overall development and the safety of people's assets.

He said that Shandong should fully and faithfully implement the new development philosophy, further deepen reform in order to be a pioneer in serving and integrating into the new development paradigm, in advancing innovation in economic and social development, and in promoting ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin. The province was urged to accelerate the building of itself into a pilot zone for green, low-carbon, and high-quality development, and into a new highland for high-level opening up to the outside world so as to write a chapter of Chinese modernization of its own.
From May 22 to 24, Xi conducted fact-finding missions in cities including Rizhao and Jinan. He was accompanied by Lin Wu, secretary of CPC Shandong Provincial Committee, and Zhou Naixiang, governor of Shandong.
On the afternoon of May 22, Xi first visited Rizhao Port. The port stands as an important transfer base of energy resources and bulk raw materials. In the past few years, the port has boosted smart and green development, and developed into a parallel, open and fully automated container terminal. Xi was briefed on port development and construction in Shandong province as well as the planning and layout of Rizhao Port, and inspected the operation scenario of a fully automated container terminal. Xi said that Rizhao Port, as a new port after China's reform and opening-up drive, has transformed itself from a traditional port into a modern one through scientific and technological innovation in recent years. It has not only made the cargo throughput among the forefront of the country, but also accumulated experience in developing new quality productive forces through the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, which is worthy of praise. Xi extended cordial greetings to port science and technology workers, operation personnel and shipping personnel, hoping that everyone will make continuous efforts and continue to work hard to raise the management and operation of Rizhao Port to a higher level.
Later on, Xi inspected the Sunshine Coast Greenway in Rizhao City. In recent years, Rizhao City has carried out an ecological restoration project on the exposed coastal sites and damaged shoreline, and built about 28 kilometers of coast greenway, providing citizens and tourists with a good place for sports and leisure. Xi was briefed on the overall construction of the greenway, and inspected the ecological environment of the coastline that has been restored and harnessed. He learned about how local culture and tourism industries have been upgraded and what measures have been taken to improve the quality of local residents' life, and once in a while he talked with citizens and tourists. He pointed out that the construction of the greenway meets residents' need and is a popular project. To advance Chinese modernization is to constantly improve people's lives, and a more favorable environment brings a real sense of happiness to the residents, Xi said. He urged local people to work together in building and protecting their beautiful homeland.
On the morning of May 24, Xi listened to the report of CPC Shandong Provincial Committee and Shandong provincial government on their work in Jinan, and affirmed what the province has achieved in various aspects of its work.
Xi pointed out that Shandong has great potential to tap in promoting the deep integration of innovation in science and technology and that in industries, in developing new quality productive forces, and improving modern industrial system. He said that with focus on national strategic needs, Shandong should coordinate efforts to transform and upgrade traditional industries, nurture and expand emerging industries, and advance the layout of future industries, while unleashing the effectiveness of integrating the real economy with the digital economy, and developing new quality productive forces in light of local conditions. Xi also noted that the province should vigorously promote the transformation of its development mode to a green and low-carbon one, and advance innovation in green and environmentally friendly science and technology and industrial development. The province was urged to deeply align with the coordinated regional development strategy and strive to become an important economic growth pole in north China. Shandong should give full play to its unique advantage of boasting abundant marine resources, manage well the ocean, and leverage the resources to achieve strength, striving to build a world-class cluster of ports to create a highland for the development of a modern marine economy.
Xi urged Shandong to take the lead in further deepening reform across the board and promoting high-level opening up. To advance Chinese modernization, the province should focus its efforts on addressing major problems that constrain high-quality development, on improving systems and mechanisms, and on injecting vitality and impetus into its economy. The province should actively develop an international logistics corridor, vigorously promote innovation through collaboration in free trade zones, and build a demonstration area of institutional opening up. The province should also integrate itself into high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative, and build a high-level platform for international exchange and cooperation so as to become an important hub for smooth domestic and international economic flows.
Xi pointed out that as a major agricultural province and leading grain producer, Shandong plays a crucial role in safeguarding China's food security. It is imperative for the province to deepen integrated development of urban and rural areas, advance rural revitalization across the board, and improve the quality and efficiency of making plans and arrangements for villages. The province should intensify efforts to develop modern agriculture, and develop rural industries with local characteristics and the processing industry of agricultural products, extend the industrial chain and enhance the value chain. The development of high-standard cropland should be advanced to increase grain output and quality, so as to build a ""granary of Qilu"" at a higher level. It is essential for the province to consolidate and expand the achievement in poverty alleviation, expand the path for common prosperity, improve efficiency of its agricultural sector, boost income for farmers and inject vitality into rural areas. The province should apply and further develop the ""Fengqiao model"" for promoting community-level governance in the new era, guide community-level governance through Party building, improve primary-level Party organizations' capacity of leading primary-level governance, and improve the quality of public services in rural areas so as to consolidate the harmony and stability in rural areas, with residents living and working in peace and contentment.
Xi stressed that Shandong should shoulder the new mission of cultural development in the new era, and take proactive actions to promote cultural prosperity, build the country's strength in culture and advance modern Chinese civilization. It is imperative to stay confident in our own culture, further explore the best of fine traditional Chinese culture, advance its innovative transformation and development, and deepen exchanges and mutual learning with other civilizations through events such as the International Confucius Cultural Festival to enhance the appeal of Chinese culture. Efforts should be made to protect and utilize the revolutionary resources, vigorously carry forward the revolutionary traditions of Yimeng Mountain, and pass on such traditions from generation to generation. It is imperative to extensively practice the core socialist values, continuously further cultural and ethical advancement in urban and rural areas, promote the transformation of outdated rural customs, and make it possible for the ideas of modern civilization to gain acceptance in rural areas. It is a must to develop cultural programs and the cultural sector, launch new cultural programs for the benefit of residents, and vigorously advance cultural digitization. As a result, advanced socialist culture will add impetus and efficiency to economic development, add diversity and charm to tourism and leisure, and add positive energy and vitality to urban and rural society.
Xi stressed the necessity of upholding the Party's leadership and doing a good job in Party building in order to advance Chinese modernization. The ongoing campaign for the study of the Party discipline across the whole Party is one of the major tasks of Party building this year. Party organizations at all levels must carry out the study in a well-organized, steady, down-to-earth and efficient manner. It is imperative to strengthen education on awareness against corruption and do a good job in promoting the study and dissemination of Party disciplines through cases. As a result, being in awe of what one does and the awareness of self-discipline should become a daily reminder. Efforts should be made to guide Party members and officials to faithfully understand and observe the Party disciplines. On the basis of that, they should be encouraged to devote themselves to work, do whatever they believe is right without hesitation, forge ahead with determination, and take the initiative to make achievements that live up to the expectations of the people and the times. The campaign for the study of the Party discipline should be an opportunity for further fight against pointless formalities so as to reduce burden on primary-level officials and create a good environment for them to do their work well.
Xi stressed that Party committees and governments at all levels should ensure both development and security, and make great efforts to prevent and defuse risks in key areas such as small and medium-sized financial institutions, local government debt, and real estate. Those in charge must be held to account in earnest for workplace safety, preparation must be made in advance to preempt possible floods and other disasters, and work must be done to screen safety hazards in all areas so as to effectively forestall them.
Cai Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, accompanied Xi on the inspection tour.
Li Ganjie, He Lifeng, and leading officials from relevant central Party and state departments were also on the inspection tour.
On the morning of May 23, Xi met with military officers above colonel level of the armed forces stationed in Jinan. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, he extended sincere greetings to all officers and soldiers of Jinan-based troops, and had a photo taken with the military officers. Zhang Youxia accompanied Xi during the meeting.

People.cn,"Tian Yi, Liang Jun",Politics,20240525,1457,,,"Xi chairs symposium, urging further reform centering on Chinese modernization","BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping, Chinese president, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, presided over a symposium attended by representatives from businesses and academia in Jinan, Shandong Province on May 23. Xi delivered an important speech. Xi emphasized that at its 20th National Congress, the CPC made a grand blueprint for building a modern socialist country in all respects, and made arrangements for fulfilling the task of promoting the building of a strong country through a Chinese path to modernization on all fronts, and realizing national rejuvenation. He urged the need for deepening reform across the board with efforts centering on advancing Chinese modernization. In doing this, prominence must be given to the most important aspect of reform, orientation for values must be upheld, and particular attention be paid to the way reform is carried out so that impetus will be given to the fulfilling of core tasks and the achieving of strategic goals.
Wang Huning, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Cai Qi, director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, attended the symposium. Both are members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
At the forum, nine representatives of entrepreneurs and experts made speeches one after another. They include Liu Mingsheng, chairman and Party secretary of State Power Investment Corporation Limited, Zuo Ding, chairman and Party secretary of Shenzhen Capital Group Co., Ltd., Ding Shizhong, board chairman of ANTA Sports Products Limited., Xu Guanju, chairman of Zhejiang Transfar Group Co., Ltd., Xu Daquan, president of Bosch (China) Investment Ltd., Victor K. Fung, chairman of Hong Kong Fung Group, Zhou Qiren, professor of the National School of Development of Peking University, Huang Hanquan, head of the Chinese Academy of Macroeconomic Research, and Zhang Bin, deputy director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. They put forward opinions and suggestions on deepening the reform of the power system, developing venture capital investment, transforming and upgrading traditional industries with technology, establishing and improving the governance system of private enterprises, optimizing the business environment for foreign-funded enterprises, promoting Hong Kong's better integration into the new development paradigm, enhancing people's sense of gain in reform, promoting integrated urban and rural development, and improving the macroeconomic governance system. While they were delivering speeches, Xi had in-depth discussions with those present at intervals, and the atmosphere was lively and vibrant.
After listening to their speeches, Xi delivered an important address. He said that the CPC Central Committee would conduct fact-finding missions and widely solicit opinions from all sectors before making major decisions and drafting important documents. This has always been the practice and fine tradition of the Party. The relevant parties should carefully study whether the opinions and suggestions put forward at this symposium for further deepening reform across the board should be adopted.
Reform is the driving force for development, Xi said. He noted that to deepen reform further across the board, efforts should be focused on the overarching goals of improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and modernizing China's governance system and capacity. He also stressed the need to advance Chinese modernization, combine goal-oriented and problem-oriented approaches, and address issues directly for targeted improvements. Work must be done to resolutely overcome the ideological and institutional ills that hinder the smooth progress of Chinese modernization, remove deep-rooted barriers in institutions and mechanisms, and address structural problems, so as to continuously provide strong impetus and institutional safeguards for advancing Chinese modernization.
Xi stressed that efforts must be focused on major problems and important aspects of these problems in deepening reform across the board. It is imperative to adhere to and improve our country's basic economic system, build a high-level system for socialist market economy, and optimize the regulatory system for macro economy as well as the systems and mechanisms for high quality development. It is important to optimize the systems and mechanisms for innovation in all domains and integrated urban-rural development, further emancipate and develop the productive forces, enhance social dynamics and make it possible for the productive forces and the relations of production to better adapt to each other, and so do the economic basis and the superstructure to each other. Promoting economic reform should focus on practical needs and start from addressing the most pressing issues. Theoretical innovation should be deepened and institutional innovation advanced in the process of solving practical issues. Planning reform in other areas should also focus on holistic and strategic issues, so that the details are easy to arrange when the general plan is laid out.
Xi noted that the people's aspiration for a better life is what we have been striving for, and promoting reform and boosting development boils down to that ultimate goal as well. It is imperative to plan and advance reform with a focus on the people's overall, fundamental and long-term interests, and do a good job in implementing the Party's mass line in the new era. As such, by addressing people's immediate concerns such as employment, increasing incomes, education, health care services, housing, services for people's daily affairs, child care, elderly care and the safety of people's lives and property, we may identify where reform should be intensified and breakthroughs can be made. Reform measures addressing the most pressing concerns of the people and responding to their will should be taken as many as possible, and concrete approaches that deliver real benefits to the people, win their approval and respect their will should be adopted as many as possible, so that the reform can ensure that the people have a stronger sense of fulfillment, happiness and security.
Xi stressed that reform should do away with outdated rules and establish new ones. With proper ways, we may achieve twice as much for half the effort. Otherwise, we might achieve half as much for twice the effort or even negative result. It is a must to uphold fundamental principles and break new ground. No matter how the reform is carried out, it is imperative to resolutely adhere to fundamental principles such as upholding the Party's overall leadership, upholding Marxism, following the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and upholding the people's democratic dictatorship. At the same time, it is also important to innovate boldly, reform what can and should be reformed, and follow through the reform once the target is set. It is imperative to strengthen the integration of systems, promote reform with systems thinking and consideration for the bigger picture. It is also imperative to strengthen the coordination and mutual complementation of reform measures and make reform measures in different fields and sectors work in the same direction and form synergy for better overall efficacy. The phenomenon of policies going their own ways and constraining each other must be prevented and overcome. Reform hinges not only on planning but also on implementation of measures. It is essential to hammer away at how reform measures can be implemented to the letter. On the one hand, proactive approaches must be adopted, and on the other hand, reform must be carried out in a steady manner. Priorities must be clarified, and the timing and intensity of measures must be ensured for good effect. We must do our best within our capability, and should never be divorced from reality.
Li Ganjie and He Lifeng attended the symposium. Also present were leading officials from relevant central authorities and government departments, leading officials of Shandong Province, representatives from state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, Hong Kong-funded enterprises, Macao-funded enterprises, Taiwan-funded enterprises, ""little giant"" enterprises that use specialized and sophisticated technologies, self-employed businesses, experts and scholars.

(Xinhua/Ju Peng)
JINAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday stressed the need to deepen reform further across the board with efforts centering on advancing Chinese modernization.
Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks while chairing a symposium in Jinan, Shandong Province, attended by representatives from businesses and academia.
""Reform is the driving force for development,"" Xi said, noting that to deepen reform further on all fronts, efforts should be focused on the overarching goals of improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and modernizing China's governance system and capacity.
He added that China should take resolute steps to remove the ideological and institutional barriers hindering the advancement of Chinese modernization, and double down on its efforts to resolve deep-seated institutional challenges and structural issues.
Xi's trip to Shandong is the first local inspection he has made since the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau held a meeting on April 30.
It was decided at the meeting that the third plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee will be held in Beijing in July, and that the session will primarily examine issues related to further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernization.
Nine representatives including entrepreneurs from state-owned, private and foreign-funded enterprises spoke at the symposium to put forward opinions and suggestions on deepening reform across the board, covering such issues as developing venture capital investment, upgrades of traditional industries, improving the corporate governance of private enterprises and optimizing the business environment for foreign enterprises.
It is the CPC's consistent approach and fine tradition to conduct in-depth research and extensively solicit opinions from various parties before making major decisions and formulating important documents, Xi said, adding that relevant departments should carefully study and absorb opinions and suggestions for further deepening reform in an all-round way that were brought up during the symposium.
China should adhere to and develop its basic economic system and work to build a high-level socialist market economy system, Xi said.
Economic system reform should start from meeting realistic needs and tackling the most urgent matters, and should advance theoretical and institutional innovation in the process of solving practical problems, he added.
""The Chinese people's aspiration for a better life is the goal we have been striving for, and the ultimate purpose of advancing reform and promoting development is to improve the livelihood of the people,"" Xi said.
He emphasized the need to identify the key areas of reform and achieve breakthroughs based on the pressing concerns and aspirations of the general public, including employment, income growth, education, healthcare, housing, government services, childcare, elderly care, personal safety, and property security.
Xi stressed that no matter how and where reform goes, certain ""fundmental things"" must not be compromised, including upholding the overall leadership of the Party, adhering to Marxism, sticking to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and upholding the people's democratic dictatorship.
""At the same time, we must dare to innovate and do a good job in reforming what should be and could be reformed, and persist in our efforts once we find the right path,"" Xi said.
Wang Huning, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Cai Qi, director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, who are also members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended the symposium.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Politics,20240522,803,,,"Mainland says Lai takes more radical ""Taiwan independence"" stance","BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Lai Ching-te has taken a more radical stance seeking ""Taiwan independence"" in his speech upon assuming the role of Taiwan region's new leader, a Chinese mainland spokesperson said Tuesday.
Full of hostility and provocation and made up of lies and deception, Lai's Monday speech is a confession of ""Taiwan independence,"" said Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, in response to a media query for further comments on Lai's speech.
The speech fully demonstrated that Lai is ""a traitor to mainstream public opinion on the island and a disruptor of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,"" Chen said.
It is clear that from the very beginning of his tenure, Lai cannot help but to expose his true colors as an advocate for ""Taiwan independence"" with an extremely arrogant attitude and more radical views, he said.
Not only did he fail to address the fundamental question of the nature of cross-Strait relations, but he also attempted to change the nature of the relations, which poses a serious challenge to the one-China principle, he said.
Chen reminded Lai of the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and its future can only be determined by more than 1.4 billion Chinese people, including compatriots in Taiwan.
In his speech, Lai has turned to external forces for support of his independence agenda. However, no matter how much he fawns on external forces and seeks their support, he will always be a ""pawn,"" Chen noted, adding that the ""pawn"" will inevitably become a discarded piece because ""Taiwan independence"" is a dead end and the attempts to seek independence by inviting in external forces will only backfire.
""Compatriots on both sides of the Strait are Chinese and belong to the Chinese nation. No one desires more than we do to achieve national reunification through peaceful means,"" Chen said.
""However, in response to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities' collusion with external forces to provoke and seek independence, we must counteract and punish them,"" he added.
Lai's attempts to incite ""anti-China"" sentiments and pursue ""independence"" by force will only push Taiwan into a dangerous situation of military conflict, Chen said.
In his speech, Lai talked superficially about ""dialogue"" and ""exchanges,"" misleading people to believe that he has good intentions and sincerity to improve cross-Strait relations, Chen noted.
""However, the inability of mainland residents and students to travel to Taiwan for tourism or study is entirely caused by the DPP authorities,"" he said, adding that Lai showed no genuine intent to promote cross-Strait exchanges or improve the island's economy.
No matter what Lai says or how he says it, it cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China, nor can it alter the common desire of compatriots on both sides of the Strait to become closer and more connected. It also cannot stop the irreversible trend of China's reunification, Chen said.

Xi pointed out that since China's reform and opening-up, especially since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the country's tourism sector has entered a fast lane of development. China has become the biggest domestic tourism market in the world, the largest source of international tourists, and a main destination for international travelers. The country's tourism has developed from a small and weak sector into a big and strong industry. It has increasingly become an emerging strategic pillar industry, which has contributed to the people's wellbeing and their sense of happiness. China has successfully blazed a path of tourism development with distinct characteristics, he said.
Xi stressed that on the new journey of the new era, tourism development is facing new opportunities and challenges. To improve the modern tourism industry and speed up building China into a leading tourism nation, it is a must, under the guidance of the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, to fully and faithfully implement the new development philosophy on all fronts, uphold fundamental principles and break new ground, enhance quality and efficiency, pursue integrated development, and coordinate the government and the market, supply and demand, protection and development, domestic and international markets as well as development and security. Only in this way will tourism better contribute to meeting people's growing needs for a better life, economic development, the building of a spiritual home, the showcasing of China's image, and mutual learning among civilizations.
He stressed the need for all regions and departments to strengthen the sense of responsibility and mission in their work, do their share of work well and coordinate joint efforts for the implementation of policies to promote the high-quality development of the tourism industry and ensure its steady and sustainable growth.
A national meeting on the development of the tourism sector was held on May 17 in Beijing. Li Shulei, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, conveyed Xi's important instructions at the meeting and delivered a speech. He urged efforts to study and implement Xi's important instructions and remarks on the development of the tourism sector, and to advance tourism with culture and promote culture with tourism, blazing a path with its own characteristics for the development of China's tourism. It is imperative to promote high-quality development of the tourism sector, speed up building China into a country strong in tourism, strengthen systematic planning and well-calibrated layout, and protect cultural heritage and ecological resources.

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Politics,20240521,809,,,One-China principle anchor of peace across Taiwan Strait: Chinese FM,"ASTANA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said here Monday that the one-China principle is what underpins peace across the Taiwan Strait.
He made these remarks on the sidelines of the meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Astana, to expound on China's solemn position regarding Taiwan region's new leader's assumption of office.
Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said that the one-China principle cannot be violated. No matter how the political situation on the Taiwan island changes, it will not change the historical and legal facts that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China, he said.
Wang noted that recently, political leaders and people from all walks of life in many countries, including member states of the SCO, have made a just voice of abiding by the one-China principle and firmly supporting China's just cause of opposing ""Taiwan independence"" and promoting reunification, which once again shows that the fundamental situation regarding international community's adherence to the one-China principle is unshakable.
Anyone who attempts to challenge the one-China principle will inevitably fail, he said. Every time they stir up trouble, the international community's consensus on upholding the one-China principle shall further consolidate, and the understanding and support for China's position shall add up, he said, adding that this is the truth that a just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust cause finds little support.
Separatist attempts for ""Taiwan independence"" are doomed to fail, said Wang.
The 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation clearly stipulated that Taiwan, a Chinese territory stolen by Japan, shall be restored to China. These documents with international legal effect formed an integral part of the post-WWII international order and constitute the collective memory of the international community, he said.
Wang noted that separatist attempts for ""Taiwan independence"" constitutes the most serious challenge to the international order, the most dangerous change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, and the most significant damage to peace across the Taiwan Strait.
The Chinese foreign minister said that the one-China principle is the fundamental prerequisite and political foundation for China to establish and develop relations with all other countries, and it is also what underpins peace across the Taiwan Strait.
The general trend of China's reunification is irreversible, Wang said.
The Chinese nation has a common belief that the territory is indivisible, the country cannot be destabilized, the nation cannot be separated, and the civilization cannot be broken, he said, adding that this is the historical inevitability and internal logic of China's eventual reunification.
He said that the Taiwan question is China's internal affair. Realizing China's complete reunification is a shared aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation and a historical trend that no force can stop.

Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, made the remarks when asked if the coast guard's recent patrols were aimed at pressuring Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities to settle the fatal fishing boat incident in the waters.
The incident in February was caused by the Taiwan side's brutal expulsion of a mainland fishing boat and resulted in injuries and deaths of the fishermen aboard.
The mainland will not tolerate the DPP authorities' brutal actions in disregard of the safety and property of the mainland fishermen, Chen said.
""The DPP authority should offer an explanation to the bereaved families and compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait at an early date; otherwise, they will be held accountable for all outcomes,"" he said.
Noting that it was the relevant departments' untrustworthiness and irresponsibility that kept the incident unresolved, Chen urged the DPP authorities to stop political maneuvering, demonstrate its sincerity, and address the issue with real actions.

Residents of Shixia Village in Yanqing District recently wrote to Xi, reporting their work in protecting the Great Wall and changes taking place in the village.
In the reply letter, Xi said he was pleased to learn that the villagers had taken the initiative over the years to protect the Great Wall, inherit the Great Wall culture, and rely on its resources on their way to prosperity.
The Great Wall is a representative symbol of the Chinese nation and an important symbol of the Chinese civilization, Xi said. ""It is our common responsibility to protect and pass on this historical and cultural heritage.""

People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",Politics,20240515,1518,,,"Practice of China's state compensation system highlights human rights, rule of law","BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- This year marks the 30th anniversary of the promulgation of China's State Compensation Law, a significant milestone in the country's commitment to human rights protection and the rule of law.
The law, adopted by China's national legislature in May 1994, as stated in its first article, is formulated to safeguard the relevant rights of citizens, legal persons and other organizations, and promote state organs' law-based exercise of their functions and powers.
Since the law took effect on January 1, 1995, Chinese courts nationwide have dealt with 318,000 state compensation cases.
Notable examples include the cases of Huugjilt and Nie Shubin, both executed based on wrongful convictions in the 1990s and acquitted in the mid-2010s.
""The compensation cases are like an alarm bell, calling on state agencies and their staff to uphold the respect and protection of human rights and exercise their power prudently to avoid more similar tragedies,"" said Liu Fei, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law.
In addition to citizens' right to life and personal liberty, the state compensation system also covers the protection of property rights.
By compensating the infringed persons in accordance with the law, the State Compensation Law has exerted remarkable effects on the country's political, social, and legal sectors and has garnered widespread recognition from society, according to Ma Huaide, president of the China University of Political Science and Law.
According to Xue Gangling, a professor at the South China Normal University, the state compensation system, an important symbol of the modernization of the rule of law, provides a unique orientation towards human rights values in society.
Also, Ma pointed out that by defining the boundaries of infringement and attributing responsibility, as well as establishing an accountability system, the law serves as a reminder of the importance of law-based governance.
Over the decades, China has been continuously making improvements to the law and its practice.
The law has undergone two amendments, which were made in 2010 and 2012, respectively.
The compensatory payment for infringement of personal liberty has increased from 17.76 yuan (about 2.5 U.S. dollars) per day at the beginning to 436.89 yuan last year.
The country's top court and top procuratorate have issued judicial interpretations, as well as replies in individual cases, to ensure the effectiveness and implementation of the law.
These efforts have further expanded the protection of rights, granting the victims a higher level and wider range of compensation such as that for mental suffering, according to Du Yifang, a law professor at Fudan University.
Zhang Hong, a professor at Beijing Normal University, said the improved procedural rules have helped make the victims' claim for remedies easier.
However, experts also pointed out that despite the considerable progress made, there is still a need for further improvements.
Xue said that the scope of state compensation can be further expanded, the procedures can be made more streamlined and fair, and the standards can continue to be raised. Zhang said that the principles and standards of state compensation should be adjusted to align with the changing times.
The amendment of the State Compensation Law is currently listed in the legislative plan of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress.
The 30-year practice of the state compensation system has demonstrated that governmental departments that are willing to acknowledge mistakes and take responsibility can establish their credibility, Liu said.

Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, made the remarks at a press conference in response to a question about possible content regarding cross-Strait relations in Lai Ching-te's upcoming inauguration speech.
Chen said mainstream public opinion on the island is in favor of peace not war, development not decline, communication rather than separation, and cooperation instead of confrontation.
Whether to follow the will of the people and take the path of peaceful development, or to go against popular will and engage in provocation and confrontation, is a question which not only matters to the interests and well-being of the compatriots of Taiwan but also to future development of Taiwan as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, Chen said.

The cases, published by the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), involved reconsideration or review procedures about procuratorial agencies' prior decisions not to approve the arrest of certain criminal suspects or not to indict them.
In one case, it was made clear that when handling cases involving concealment of illegal gains of a crime, prosecutors should carry out comprehensive examinations based on the specific circumstances, consequences, the degree of social harm, as well as the nature and consequences of the prior crime, to determine whether the case is prosecutable.
Other cases involved the determination of prosecutable violations of theft, lodging lawsuit for fraud, and organizing prostitution activities.
It was further stressed in the cases that while dealing with reconsideration and review cases, substantial examination is needed, and the prosecutors should listen to the opinions of the public security authorities, and explain the facts of the case and the reasons as well as the legal basis for their decisions.
According to the SPP, the reconsideration and review procedure of relevant decisions facilitates mutual check and balance between public security and procuratorial authorities, and it is also an internal supervision within the procuratorial system.
Procuratorial agencies should work with public security authorities to build a criminal prosecution system centered around evidence, fully leverage the role of the reconsideration and review procedure in preventing and rectifying errors, to ensure justice in law enforcement and judicial work, the SPP statement said.
According to China's criminal procedure law, procuratorial agencies may decide not to approve the arrest of a suspect or not to indict them for reasons such as insufficient evidence or that relevant action is unnecessary.
However, the police may require or apply for a reconsideration or review of relevant decision if they believe it wrong.

Registration for the 77th WHA closes on Monday.
""Our position is consistent and clear regarding the Taiwan region's participation in the activities of the World Health Organization. It must be dealt with under the one-China principle, which is also a basic principle enshrined in the UNGA Resolution 2758 and WHA Resolution 25.1,"" said Chen Binhua, spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office.
The DPP authorities have stubbornly stuck to the separatist position of ""Taiwan independence,"" and have refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus. Thus, the political foundation for the Taiwan region's participation in the WHA no longer exists, he said.
The central government has always been concerned about the health and well-being of Taiwan compatriots, and has made appropriate arrangements for the Taiwan region's participation in global health endeavors, with 21 batches of Taiwan experts able to take part in the WHO's technical activities over the past year; and the region can promptly access health emergency information from the WHO, the spokesperson said.
It is thus obvious that the channels for the region's participation in the WHO's technical communication and cooperation are fully clear, its access to health emergency information and assistance is fully effective, and Taiwan compatriots' rights to health are protected, Chen said.
The true intention of the DPP authorities' manipulation of issues concerning Taiwan's participation in the WHA is to highlight the so-called ""sovereign status"" and seek independence under the guise of health, he added.

Spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remarks at a daily press briefing in response to a query on Taiwan not receiving an invitation to participate in the 77th WHA, registration for which will close Monday.
Regarding Taiwan region's participation in activities of international organizations, including the WHO, China's position is consistent and clear, that is, it must be dealt with under the one-China principle, which is also a basic principle enshrined in the UNGA Resolution 2758 and WHA Resolution 25.1, said Wang.
The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities have stubbornly stuck to the separatist position of ""Taiwan independence,"" which means that the political foundation for the Taiwan region's participation in the WHA no longer exists, he said.
China's relevant decision is founded on a solid legal basis, which is not only to uphold the one-China principle, but also to safeguard the seriousness and authority of relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly and the WHA, Wang said.
He went on to point out that for some time, the DPP authorities and certain countries have deliberately distorted and challenged the UNGA Resolution 2758, trumpeted the notion that Taiwan's status is undetermined, and encouraged Taiwan's participation in multilateral forums in the UN system, including the WHA, misleading the opinion and challenging the international consensus of the one-China principle.
Refuting the DPP claim that excluding Taiwan from the WHA will lead to ""a gap in the international anti-pandemic system,"" Wang said the rhetoric is a political lie. The Chinese central government has made proper arrangements for Taiwan's participation in global health affairs under the one-China principle.
The central government has approved the participation in WHO technical activities by 21 batches of Taiwan health experts over the past year. There is an International Health Regulations Contact Point in the Taiwan region for it to promptly access health emergencies information from the WHO and report such information to the WHO.
Wang said facts have proved that the central government is whole-hearted and sincere in addressing health-related issues of concern for Taiwan compatriots, and has taken active and practical steps to make sure their health rights are guaranteed.
Challenging the one-China principle will only lead to a dead end, said Wang, adding that the plot of ""using the Taiwan question to contain China"" is bound to meet firm opposition from the international community and is doomed to fail.
