Willie Robertson,"Thank you. I’m honored to be here.

As some of you know, we end every episode of Duck Dynasty with a family prayer at the dinner table. So tonight, I want to start with a prayer: “Father-God, bless our time here tonight. Let everything we say and do be pleasing and acceptable to you, and please bless our country.”I’ve always said that I have three things in common with Mr. Trump. We’re both successful businessmen. We’ve both had hit TV shows. And we both have intelligent wives who are MUCH better looking than we are.
It’s been a ROUGH year for the media experts.  It must be humbling to be  so          wrong about so much for so long.

But I have a theory about why they missed the Trump Train: they don’t hang out with regular folks like us who hunt, fish, pray and actually work for a living.
Heck, they don’t even know how to talk to people from middle America.  You   tell them you’re from Louisiana and they usually start talking REALLY SLOW AND REALLY LOUD.
Let me tell you why I’ve been on the Trump Train from the beginning. When you grow up in the South with rednecks, there are some occasional… disagreements. Disagreements sometimes turn into… fisticuffs. But anytime I was ever in a bad spot, I always knew my brothers would have my back.
Today… in a lot of ways… America is in a bad spot. We need a president who will have our back.I can promise you this: no matter who you are, DONALD TRUMP WILL  HAVE YOUR BACK.

If you’re looking for a job… or trying to grow a business… DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.
If you’re a serviceman fighting overseas… or a cop keeping us safe at home… DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.
If you’re an average American who feels like you’ve been forgotten… neglected by far away leaders… that the deck is stacked against you and you just can’t  win… DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.
He may not always tell you what you want to hear… you may not always agree… and it may not always be politically correct. (But when your dad is Phil Robertson, you get used to that sort of thing.)
But Donald Trump will always – always – tell you the truth as he sees  it.

And that’s why we can trust him to make America great again as our next president.

Thank you, and God bless you.

Gov. Rick Perry,"In 2006, Anita and I had the pleasure of touring a Naval base in San  Diego.

Our guide that day happened to be a Navy SEAL recovering from combat- related injuries.

He was a Texas boy… plainspoken and respectful… and his love for America came through loud and clear.
As we parted ways that day, we told him if you’re ever in Austin, come on by.

Now, some might call that meeting blind chance or a twist of fate… but I call it the grace of God.We kept in touch over the years… through a tour in Iraq and his return to Texas… until one day, he showed up on our doorstep… unannounced… with nowhere else to turn.We welcomed him into our home… helped him get the care he needed… and today, he’s like a second son.Many know about the battles he fought in Afghanistan… but few know about the battles that he… and thousands of veterans like him… face when they come  home.Tonight, our commitment is this: Making America great again starts by  taking

care of our veterans. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome an American hero… the Lone Survivor… Marcus Luttrell.

",2016,republican
Marcus Luttrell,"Thank you governor, and thank you for having me. Serving my country and her people both on the field of battle and here at home has been my greatest honor.

Tonight I can’t speak on behalf of all veterans, but what I can do is speak of my own experience and share first hand knowledge.
I grew up around a number of Vietnam veterans. Their country asked them to serve, and they did their duty. But they came home to hate, ridicule and judgment.

But something interesting happened as a result. Those veterans and millions of their fellow citizens raised their sons and daughters to never treat our soldiers like that again.

My dad served in Vietnam and raised me to be patriotic, to love my country, to respect those who protect Her.
And those are the values I see in America today.  We respect our veterans,   and we know we have to take care of them. That’s what they were promised, and that’s what they deserve.

One of the easiest ways to help veterans is to let them choose their own doctor so they can get care when they need it. I appreciate that Donald Trump supports this idea. It’s a great idea whose time has come.

It says a lot about this generation of Americans, that even when our government doesn’t take care of its own, the citizens stand up and form foundations to help the wounded and families of the fallen. Thank you for that, from the bottom of my heart.

Americans know that each of us has a duty, and we’re ready to do it.

Every one of us has to step up in some way. We need leaders to step up in government… citizens to step up and hold leaders accountable… and some will have to step up and answer the call of service.

Whether that means fighting on a foreign field of battle like I did, or protecting and serving on our own city streets… everyone who keeps America safe deserves our respect.

As a military man, I don’t really like to talk too much about politics. My philosophy is, just give me the mission and me and my team will go get it done.

But I will say this: In the United States military we don’t leave anyone behind, and neither should our next commander-in-chief.
As president, Donald Trump will proudly stand with our veterans and police, and so will I, because that’s the only way we will make America safe again.

Thank you and God bless you.

Scott Baio,"Thank you for the kind welcome. Aren’t we blessed to have such brave heroes protecting us like Retired Lt. Col. Charles Kettles, who just this morning received the Medal of Honor for his heroism in Vietnam?

I want to thank Mr. Trump for asking me to be here tonight. What an honor it is to talk about a man I trust with the lives of my family and the health of our country
… America … the greatest country God created.

America is an easy place to get to. But — for you first time voters — it’s important to know what it means to be an American.
It doesn’t mean getting free stuff.

It means sacrificing, winning, losing, failing, succeeding.

Sometimes doing things you don’t want to do, including the hard work … in order to get where you want to be.
That’s what being an American means.

But our country is in a bad spot right now. You can feel it and see it everywhere.
There’s no stability, nothing seems right.

All the things we hold dear are being attacked every day.

We cannot go down this road anymore. We need to stop!! We need Donald Trumpto fix this.

Is he a messiah? No, he’s just a man. A man who wants to give back to his country … America.
The country that has given him everything. A country that has given us all so much.
Now it’s time to give back to her.

We have a choice in November.

We can go for Hillary Clinton: who wants to continue the same policies that are wrecking this country.
Policies that make us unsafe.

A woman who somehow feels entitled to the presidency … that she is somehow owed it.

Or we can go for Donald Trump: A man doing this from the goodness of his heart and genuinely wants to help.
A man who knows how to get things done …and a man who says what he means and means what he says.

Hillary Clinton wants to be president for her.

Donald Trump wants to be President for us.

So, let’s make not just make America great again … let’s make America … America again!
Thank you and God Bless you.

Pat Smith,"My name is Patricia Smith.

My son Sean was one of four brave Americans killed during the 2012 terrorist attack at Benghazi.
Sean was a wonderful son and father to my two amazing grandchildren, Samantha and Nathan, now 10 and 11.
He was proud to serve his country with the United States Foreign Service.  The last time I talked to Sean, the night before the terrorist attack, he told me, “Mom, I am going to die.”

All security had been pulled from the embassy, he explained. And when he asked why, he never received a response.
Nobody listened. Nobody seemed to care.

The very next day, he was murdered by radical Islamic terrorists.

To this day, I don’t even know why a computer guy like Sean was sent to Benghazi.That night, we lost sons, brothers, fathers, and husbands.

We lost four brave Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country they chose to serve.And, the American people lost the truth.

For all of this loss, for all of this grief, for all of the cynicism the tragedy in Benghazi has wrought upon America, I blame Hillary Clinton.

I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son.

In an email to her daughter shortly after the attack, Hillary Clinton blamed it on terrorism.

But when I saw Hillary Clinton at Sean’s coffin ceremony, just days later, she looked me squarely in the eye and told me a video was responsible.

Since then, I have repeatedly asked Hillary Clinton to explain to me the real reason why my son is dead.
I’m still waiting.

Whenever I called the State Department, no one would speak to me because they say I am “not a member of the immediate family.”

Sean is my SON.

Hillary Clinton is a woman, a mother and a grandmother of two. I am a woman, a mother and a grandmother of two.
How could she do this to me? How could she do this to any American family?Donald Trump is everything Hillary Clinton is not.
He is blunt, direct, and strong.

He speaks his mind, and his heart.

And, when it comes to the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism, he will not hesitate to kill the terrorists who threaten American lives.

He will make America stronger, not weaker. This entire campaign comes down to  a single question.If Hillary Clinton… can’t give us the TRUTH… why should we give HER the presidency

",2016,republican
Mark Geist (OZ) and John Tiegen (TIG),"OZ – Thank you America for showing us the support and dedication that should have been offered by Hillary and her State Department to those who saved their butts.

TIG – September 11, 2012, at approximately 9:35 pm, we got a call that the consulate was under attack. We immediately grabbed our weapons and armed up. We were ready to go. But on three separate occasions, we were told to wait, and the Chief of base told us to STAND DOWN!

We heard State Department Security scream over the radio, “If you don’t get here now, we are all going to DIE!” They were under siege. Stand-down orders be dammed.  We went.

Pulling up to the consulate, we saw fire and smoke pouring out of the Ambassador’s residence. I saw one of the State department security officers pulling Sean Smith’s lifeless body from the building. He was dead. We moved into the building looking for the Ambassador. The heat from the fire blasted our faces. The smoke obliterated our sight. We crawled on our bellies to stay under it.
Tanto and DB came through the back gate and made their way onto the consulate grounds. After several minutes, Tanto helped State gather sensitive material and prepared them to leave in their armored vehicle.

Suddenly, we started receiving small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades from the back gate.  I made my way to the roof to get a better firing position.  As  I moved up to the edge of the building, I saw one of the terrorists come out from behind the wall into the driveway.

He fired an RPG, reloaded, and fired again.

On his third attempt, I hit him with a 10 round volley, killing him. But there were more where he came from. We had information that 100 terrorists were getting ready to mount another counter-assault. We didn’t know if the Ambassador was  still at the Consulate, but we had reason to believe he was dead. We were responsible for 30 other people. We had to make a decision. We decided to head back to the Annex.

OZ – As the team arrived back at the annex, we took up fighting positions. We knew the terrorists were headed our way.We were ready for them!! We saw movement on the east side of our compound. Something with sparks trailing it flew over the wall and landed between Tig and me.

It exploded. So, we unleashed hell.

There were about twenty terrorists in the first wave. They went away with a whole lot less.
TIG – After that first attack, Oz grabbed his med kit and pulled out medical gauze.  He stuffed it in his ears.
I looked at him, smiled and asked, “Was it loud much?” OZ –  My ears felt like they had exploded.
Tig was firing next to my left ear.

Soon we got word that the Support team from Tripoli led by Glen Doherty had landed at the Benghazi airport. You think security at our airports is bad…Try landing at an airport controlled by a local militia with a bunch of guns and a bag of money.

Thank goodness money talks!

TIG – Around 1:30 am, the Ambassador was still missing. We saw movement again on our eastern perimeter. We called Bob and asked if anyone was coming to secure the perimeter.  He said “I don’t know.”

At that point, a vehicle came out of the darkness. A guy jumped out and drew his arm back like he was about to throw something.
Oz saw this and put three rounds into him, dropping him like a sack of potatoes. Another guy took his place.
Then another. And another.

OZ –  It was like whack-a-mole.

One would pop his head up shooting, and we’d knock him off. Someone would take his place, and we’d shoot him.

TIG – Then, we got a call saying the Ambassador was at the hospital in Benghazi.There was no way to determine if this was valid or if he was alive or dead. We thought it could have been a trick to get us to come out of our defensive positions and split up.So we decided to stay put.

OZ – Up on the roof, Rone told me that if if weren’t for Tig, he would have died back at the compound.
We also talked about our kids and how many of us here in Benghazi had young children.
Heck, Jack had just found out that his wife was  pregnant.

We didn’t know if we would see them again.

Morning approached. It was that time when the black sky starts turning blue and you could hear the morning prayer over the loud speakers. We knew the next attack was coming. Over the radio, we heard Glen and the Tripoli team were on their way.
When Glen arrived, he joined us on the roof.

I was sure glad to have another gun fighter.

The attack started with a rocket propelled grenade and small arms fire from the north.

Then a mortar hit the top of our outer wall.

The state Department Security guy yelled out he was hit. We opened fire.

A second mortar hit the top of the roof to my right by about 15 feet. The explosion knocked me back.

As I got up, I noticed Rone in a fetal position at my feet.

I went to grab my rifle with my left hand and noticed it was hanging at a right angle.

A third mortar hit the roof. Glen fell face down.

He was out of the fight.

I tried again to get my arm to work, it wouldn’t. The fourth mortar hit.

It felt like I was stung by a thousand bees.  I dove for cover and everything went quiet.

I pulled out a tourniquet from my med kit to put on my arm. But I got distracted and reached over to Rone and to check for a pulse.
There wasn’t one.

I looked up and saw Tig climbing onto the roof.

The dust and debris of war continued to fall around us.

TIG – As I came over the top of the wall, I saw that the State Department security officer was in bad shape.

His left arm was hanging at a right angle like Oz’s arm, and his left leg was almost severed about six inches above the ankle.

I put tourniquets on both the arm and the leg. I then moved over to the next sound I heard. It was Oz whining like a girl.

He was playing with his injured arm. I told told him to quit playing with it. OZ –  Hey I was trying to get it to work.

It wouldn’t stay in place.

TIG – I grabbed the tourniquet that Oz had started to put on, got it in place, and helped him stand up.

I asked him if he could get to the ladder by himself.

OZ –  I told him hell yes.

I knew Tig needed to check on Glen and Rone. I was hoping they were still alive.

I sat on the edge of the ledge looking at the ladder and trying to figure how I was going to climb down.

I survived several attacks on the annex, but wouldn’t it be my luck to fall off this darn roof and break my neck? Yea that’s the story I want my kids to hear.

I hooked my good arm around the top rung of the ladder and swung my body to try to land my feet on the first rung.
My feet missed.

I pulled myself up with my good arm and climbed down. Once inside the building, I laid down on the floor.
I knew I had other injuries that needed to be treated.

I told them to cut my clothes off, and that’s when they found another 20-30 shrapnel holes.

TIG –  After I got Oz over to the ladder, I went over to Rone.  I rolled him  over.

I pulled his body armor off and checked for vitals. I checked his pupils.

No sign of life.

I said a prayer over him. Next I went over to Glen.

I checked his vitals and pupil dilation. No response.

No sign of life.

I also said a prayer over Glen.

I picked up their gear and weapons. We knew it was time to move. We had to get everyone out.  We couldn’t defend against indirect fire.

OZ – We stabilized the wounded, secured the dead, and made sure we left no critical information behind.

The militia that escorted us to the airport were Gaddafi  loyalists.

Upon arrival, we loaded up the non-shooting personnel. I was in the back of a pickup truck.

People came over to carry me on the plane. I sat up and brushed ’em off.

I said, “I walked into Benghazi. I’m walking out.”

TIG – That plane was the same plane that brought Glen and the guys from Tripoli down to Benghazi. This time, Glen wasn’t on it.
This was a plane that was secured by the Tripoli team from a local Libyan, they had just met that day.

We got everyone loaded up and headed to Tripoli.

We turned to the task of getting the ambassador’s body from the hospital. The Gaddafi loyalist commander volunteered to get him.
Once he returned with the Ambassador, we checked to verify his identity and his condition.

He was in the same clothes I saw him wearing that morning on September 11th. There were no signs of torture or mutilation.
He died of smoke inhalation.

At that point, we didn’t know how we were going to get out of Benghazi. Out of the blue, a C130 transport aircraft landed.
It taxied over, did a u-turn and stopped.

One of the Tripoli team members went over with a translator and persuaded the pilots to take us to Tripoli.
The last American to leave Benghazi left, not on an American plane, but on a

Libyan plane flown by Libyan pilots.

The first U.S. aircraft to arrive in Libya was not a military jet but a medical transport bird that arrived at approximately 5 pm on the evening of September 12th, after the siege was over.

OZ – More than 30 American lives were saved that night. It’s because Americans never give up.We refuse to lose.

Benghazi is not about politics. It’s about opportunities.

Opportunities taken when we defied stand down orders and opportunities squandered when Hillary Clinton failed to protect her people on the ground. Had she done her job, we would not have had to compromise the annex.

Ty, Glen, Sean, and Ambassador Stevens would be alive today. Now we as Americans have the opportunity to elect someone who will make this country safe again.

Someone who will have our backs. Someone who will bring our guys home.

Someone who will lead with strength and integrity. That someone is Donald Trump.

TIG – We did our part. Now do yours. Thank you.

Antonio Sabato Jr.,"Good evening.

I’m honored to be here.

I know I am not your typical convention speaker.

You might be wondering why I chose to speak. The truth is that I’ve never considered myself very political or spoken out politically before.
But my belief in this country and my faith in Jesus Christ have compelled me to speak now.

I’m concerned about our country’s future. I’m concerned about my children’s future.

And I believe we need Donald Trump, who shares my beliefs and my faith, to get our country back on track.

In the past eight years, failed policies have caused our country to deteriorate. Our rights have been trampled and our security threatened.

We are weaker by almost every measure. We are on the wrong path.

It is clear even to someone who was not born here. I came to the United Statesfrom Rome in 1985.

I followed all the rules and finally became a naturalized citizen in 1996. Others who want to come to the U.S. to live and work should follow the same rules. We are a nation of laws for a reason.

There should be no shortcuts for those who don’t want to pay…or  wait.

My mother was born in communist Prague, escaped the Czech Republic and met my dad in Italy.

I know what socialism looks like. I don’t want that for my children.

But that’s the path we’re headed down with the leader we’ve had…and the candidate he endorses.

Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton promote division… don’t be fooled… butDonald Trump is for unity.

Donald Trump believes in one America, with liberty and justice for all. Having secure borders, protecting our citizens… none of this is hateful. This is the responsibility of the government… and the right thing to do.

Donald Trump will get it done and put us back on the right track. People know this, and that’s why they have voted as they have. We can no longer afford to be silent.

Our country needs Donald Trump to make us great again. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

Mike McCaul,"Good evening. I am Michael McCaul, Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.
I am a fourth-generation Texan, born and raised in Dallas.

Let us remember tonight the Dallas, and Louisiana, police officers who tragically lost their lives.
America stands with my hometown, and we will NEVER forget.

And to law enforcement officers across this nation, we are with you and we willalways support you.

Tonight we just heard powerful testimony from people who have been devastated by Obama’s reckless immigration policies.

Haven’t we had ENOUGH?

And now Hillary Clinton is promising more of the same – open borders, executive amnesty, and the surge of Syrian refugees.

This is a dangerous… liberal agenda… and it’s time for a change. It’s time to take back our country and make America SAFE  again!

We need to end sanctuary cities…keep dangerous people out of our country…and SECURE our borders.
Our country’s national security is at risk.

Ronald Reagan once reminded us that America was “a shining city upon a hill”…a beacon of hope to all the world.

But after eight years of weak leadership, our “city on a hill” is now a city… under siege.

Today our allies no longer trust us, our adversaries no longer fear us, and our enemies are plotting against us.

This did not happen by accident, it happened by design.

It is the work of Barack Obama… and the architect of his failed foreign policy,Hillary Clinton.

For years they presided over America’s retreat. And the consequence is clear:

leading from behind… has led us into danger.

When Hillary stopped talking about the “war on terror,” our enemies noticed…

When she helped withdraw our forces from Iraq, creating a power vacuum, she paved the way for ISIS to rear its ugly head… and our enemies  noticed…

When four Americans were murdered… and Benghazi burned, she blamed it on a video… and our enemies noticed…

And when she stood on the sidelines while terror hotspots erupted across the globe, our enemies noticed…

We have all witnessed the recent attacks in Nice, Paris, Brussels and Istanbul…but now we are in the crosshairs.

Our own city streets have become the battleground: Fort Hood.Boston.Chattanooga.
San Bernardino and Orlando.

Instead of protecting Americans, the Obama Administration turned a blind eye to the danger.So let’s cut through the suffocating political correctness and call the threat what it really is… radical Islam.
These fanatics have radicalized a religion into a weapon, and they are targeting our way of life.

President Reagan once asked, “Are you better off than you were four years ago?”

But tonight let me ask you this question: are you SAFER than you were eight years ago?
Is our military stronger?

Is America still respected?

Over and over again, Obama and Hillary apologized for America… and allowed jihadists to spread like wildfire.

We CANNOT afford Hillary in the White House again.

We NEED someone who can repair the damage she has done, take the fight to the enemy, and put America first.

That man is Donald Trump.

I am proud to serve as a member of his national security team, and I can tell you this:
Donald will NEVER apologize for American greatness… he will promote it.

He will NEVER bow down to our enemies… he will stand up to them.

And Donald will NEVER allow terrorists to gain ground against America …he willshake the ground they walk on.

My father was a bombardier in World War II and participated in the D-Day invasion against the Nazis.
His generation – the greatest – defeated fascism and communism, handing down a better and safer America to my generation.

Now, we are in a struggle against the forces of radical Islam and terror, which must be defeated for our children and grandchildren.

A Trump Administration will take on this fight and send a clear message to the Islamist terrorists: you may have fired the first shot, but rest assured, Americawill fire the last.

Thank you, and may God bless America.

David Clarke Jr. ,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to make something very clear: Blue Lives Matter!

I want to talk with you about something important, indeed, a concept that five law enforcement officers were murdered and nine more were wounded for earlier this month in Dallas, and for which three more were murdered yesterday inBaton Rouge: that is the importance of Making America Safe Again.

I believe that this noble mission is not just a requirement, but a prerequisite for achieving this campaign’s goal of Making America Great Again.
We simply cannot be great if we do not feel safe in our homes, on our streets, and in our communities.

I see this every day, at street level where many Americans increasingly have an uneasiness about the ability of their families to live safely in these troubling times. This transcends race, religion, ethnicity, gender, age, and lifestyle.

If you don’t believe it, a recent Gallup poll confirms it: more than half of all Americans now worry a great deal about crime and violence, up consistently and dramatically from just a few years ago.

For African-Americans that number is 70 percent.

Sadly for a growing number of communities the sense of safety that many of us once took for granted has been shattered.
Americans don’t always feel safe no matter if they are working in a big city, living in a suburb or  rural areas all around our great country.

I often tell residents of Milwaukee, and the cities and towns I visit that safety is a shared endeavor. It starts with the willing acceptance of people to play by society’s rules: a code we collectively agree upon that ensures stability, order, fairness, and respect.

It’s built on a foundation of trust in each other and in the people who administer and enforce society’s rules, which at its foundation is the rule of law.

In 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote passionately about “the interrelatedness of all communities and states” and about our “inescapable network of mu-tu- ALITY, tying us in a single garment of destiny.”

He spoke of the basic morality of the rule of law, provided that it is applied equally to both the wealthy and the impoverished; both men and women, and yes, the majority and the minority.

What we witnessed in Ferguson, in Baltimore, and in Baton Rouge was a collapse of social order. So many of the actions of the Occupy movement and Black Lives Matter transcend peaceful protest, and violates the code of conduct we rely on.

American law enforcement officers understand that race is and has been a heated issue in our country. Most appreciate the vital need for thoroughness and transparency in pursuit of the greater good in their actions, and in their investigations.

These are truths that are self-evident to me, and which I practice, and they are the truths that Donald Trump understands and supports. Donald Trump is the steadfast leader our nation needs.

He has spoken passionately to me of his belief in our American system of justice, and he speaks to the values that are at the foundation of our social contract.

Throughout his campaign and over many years before he has consistently and

constantly raised his voice not only in defense of the character of the American police officer, but the need for ALL people to feel they are being treated fairly and respectfully by law enforcement.

Donald Trump understands that what can make our nation safe again is a recommitment to a system of justice in which no government official, not even  those who have fought their way to the marble and granite halls of Washington; no private citizen, not even Hillary Clinton; and no group of people, despite the fervor with which they press forward their grievances, can claim privilege above the law.

The tradition of the primacy of the rule of law in America is strong. It is in those simple facts and in our acts that we will move forward and toward Making America Safe Again. God Bless you, and may God continue to bless these United States of America.

Tom Cotton,"For eight years, we’ve seen what happens when America leads from behind. Leading from behind that’s not what the Army taught me. To everyone who agrees that America should lead the way, let me say loud and clear: help is on the way.

Let me tell you a story about an Arkansas farm boy. When America was at war, he was in school and then in a comfortable job. But he sacrificed that comfort, against the wishes of his father, who himself had served. He volunteered for the Army. He became an infantryman.That farm boy was my dad. He went toVietnam in 1969.

Thirty-five years later, I did the same. Against the wishes of my family, I gave  up my legal career and I volunteered for the Army. I became an infantryman. I went to Iraq and Afghanistan. My dad said he felt like God was punishing him for what he did to his dad.

But God wasn’t punishing them; God had called us to serve. Just as He calls so many of you.

My family isn’t extraordinary; in fact, we’re very ordinary. From farms in Arkansasto fire stations in New York, many families could tell the same story. The defense of this country is a family affair.

We don’t fight because we hate our enemies, but because we love our country. We love its freedom. We love that we’re born equal and live free, that no one rules without consent.

We know these things are worth fighting and dying for because they make life worth living for.

Our warriors and their families don’t ask for much. But there are a few things we’d like.

A commander-in-chief who speaks of winning wars and not merely ending wars, calls the enemy by its name, and draws red lines carefully, but enforces them ruthlessly.

And politicians who treat our common defense as the chief responsibility of our federal government, not just another government program.

This isn’t much to ask for, but eight years without it is more than enough. So I say again: In a Trump-Pence administration and with a Republican Congress, help is on the way.

No man wants more war if he’s planned memorial services for fallen comrades, carried their flag-draped caskets off a plane, and buried them at Arlington National Cemetery.

But as Washington said: “To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.”

The purpose of our common defense, after all, is to protect our people so that we can enjoy the blessings of peacefaith, freedom, family, prosperity.

My father and his father were willing to fight so that their children and grandchildren might live in peace. That wasn’t to be. But my generation is willing to fight so that our children might live in peace.

And for that cause, I speak tonight not only to Republicans, but to the millions of Independents and Democrats who share that dream and who wish to make America safe again.

Thank you, and God bless you.

Michael Flynn,"I’m here tonight as a determined American who loves our country. And my message to you is very clear: WAKE UP AMERICA! There is no substitute for American leadership and exceptionalism. America should not fear our enemies…

In fact, we should clearly define our enemies…face them head-on…and then defeat those that seek to threaten our country and our way of life….

Tonight, we stand together as proud patriots…who deeply love our country and believe in the principles of freedom, democracy and liberty.
We know that America, our nation, is the greatest country in the history of the world.

Let there never be a substitute for America and let us sustain the conviction

that our country holds a unique place and role in history – American exceptionalism must never fade.

But now, it is up to us…and you cannot sit this election out.

I stand with you as a citizen, a veteran, a patriot but more important, as an American… to tell you that the destructive pattern of putting the interests of other nations ahead of our own will end when Donald Trump is President.

From this day forward, we must stand, tougher and stronger together, with an unrelenting goal to not draw redlines and then retreat…and to never be satisfied with reckless rhetoric from an Obama clone like Hillary  Clinton…

We must draw from the rich foundation of our founding fathers’ fight for democracy, And lead our friends and allies with more determination than ever before,

With conviction in our beliefs that pierces through the ideology of any people orany nation that attacks America’s way of life and our proud heritage of fearlessness and courage.

Tonight, Americans stand as one…with strength and confidence to overcome the last eight years of the Obama-Clinton failures…such as, bumbling indecisiveness… willful ignorance… and total incompetence that has challenged the very heart and soul of every American, and single-handedly brought continued mayhem, murder and destruction into our neighborhoods and onto the world’s streets.

On this day, we start the beginning of a new American Century – a time when we turn our heads forward with persistent and relentless focus on protecting our communities, our families and our country with feet firmly planted on the ground and by holding individuals accountable for their actions – equally and fairly.
Our new American Century does not risk its future on political correctness and senseless hyperbole.

The time is now to recognize our obligation we have to the world – an obligation to lead the world with unwavering integrity…renewed strength…and unapologetic resolve.

And, with Donald Trump in the White House, WE…WILL…MAKE…AMERICA… GREAT… AGAIN!

America’s once traditional, undisputed role as world leader is now in jeopardy. The Obama-Clinton duo failed our country by defying America’s exceptionalism and betraying our nation’s history and founding fathers’ revolutionary spirit  that established America on the principles of freedom and  democracy.

American exceptionalism was a core principle when the United States led and won our battles.

Under this doctrine we led the Allies to victory in World War Two against NaziGermany, WE are the first country to put a man on the moon, We ended the Cold War and, WE stopped communism’s quest for world domination.

As Ronald Reagan said, “If we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape to.This is the last stand on Earth.”

A centerpiece of American foreign policy was once the protection of the United States and its people and interests around the world.

Sadly, under current leadership that is no longer the case – this cannot stand. Period.

We must recognize that America has enemies in our homeland and abroad. And our military needs to be capable of protecting the nation by finding and capturing our enemies.

The President must have the tools to deal with all threats to our country, and MUST have the guts to put them into action whenever necessary.
Donald Trump is that leader.

We must regain our ability to truly crush our enemies.

And our Soldiers deserve to hear from their leaders with clarity and precision. Too often, our troops are instead distracted by trivial matters about what  word to use, what terminology is politically correct, and what bathroom door to open. War is not about bathrooms, political correctness, or words that are meaningless.

War is about winning, there is no such thing as a runner-up, and there are no consolation prizes.
A Commander-in-Chief does not draw “red-lines” and then retreat. America does not back down from anyone…or anything.

We are tired of Obama’s empty speeches and misguided rhetoric…this has caused the world to have no respect for America’s word; nor does it fear our might.

Let me be clear – Coddling and displays of empathy toward terrorists is not a strategy for defeating these murderers as Obama and Hillary Clinton would like us to believe.

And releasing terrorists will not end this war; on the contrary, it simply emboldens the terrorists and prolongs war.

Under Barack Obama, we have no coherent strategy to protect our citizens, and under Hillary Clinton, it will be more of the same.
I am infuriated when our President bans criticism of our enemies.

I am certain we cannot win this war unless we are free to call our enemies by name – – radical Islamists and failed tyrants.

Because of Obama’s ill-advised actions, the world has lost faith in American leadership…and the threats are mounting:

We have become the best enemies and the worst friends.

The next four years will be consumed by the perils we now face. And the so- called redlines or reset buttons were utter failures. And the Obama-Clinton failed foreign policy list goes on and on.

We need a Commander-in-Chief who understands these challenges and is willing to do whatever it takes to meet them head-on.
Our adversaries must never again mock American willpower and we must NEVER give them a reason to doubt our resolve to win.

The most damaging example of the President’s failure to understand the consequences of putting political expediency ahead of national security is the emergence of ISIS…We cannot continue down this path.

What keeps me up at night is the sobering realization that evil exists. The radicalization of Islam and its barbaric cause that uses modernity to influence potentially millions around the world to join their cause should keep us all up at night.

We must take seriously the possibility that these enemies have weapons of mass destruction and intend to use them.

We must understand and define our enemies if we intend to defeat them. America and Americans deserve no less!

Because Obama chose to conceal the actions of terrorists like Osama bin Ladenand groups like ISIS, and the role of Iran in the rise of radical Islam, Americans   are at a loss to fully understand the enormous threat they pose against us.

Now is the time for a leader that is honest and strong. A leader who will stand up

for America, and make absolutely clear that if you cross her path…you will  pay the price.

We do not need a weak, spineless President who is more concerned about issuing apologies than in protecting Americans.
We do not need a reckless President who believes she is above the law.

I have called on Hillary Clinton to drop out of the race because she put our nation’s security at extremely high risk with her careless use of a private email server.

If I did a tenth of what she did, I would be in jail. Crooked Hillary Clinton – leave this race now!

Before I end, I will repeat my belief that American exceptionalism is  real.

Let us not fear what we know to be true, instead we should always remember that our country was built upon, Judeo-Christian values and principles; and instead let us remember the sacrifices of those who have gone before us.

America is unique and is the greatest country in the history of the world. So get ready America, now is the time to elect fresh, bold  leadership!
I promise you that Donald Trump knows that the primary role of the President is to keep us safe.

He recognizes the threats we face and is not afraid to call them what they are.Donald Trump’s leadership, decision-making and problem-solving abilities will restore America’s role as the undeniable and unquestioned world leader.

He will lead from the front, not from behind.

He will lead with courage…never vacillating when facing our enemies or our competitors.

And he knows that the advantage in life, in business, and in wartime goes to the competitor that does not flinch and does not broadcast his game plan.
Donald Trump will execute the fundamental tenet of peace through strength…and there will be no apologies for our American exceptionalism or leadership standing around the world.

SO WAKE UP AMERICA, YOU CANNOT SIT THIS ONE OUT, instead, elect

Donald Trump as the next President of the United States. Thank you.

Jeff Sessions

Thank you good friends.  Speaking from this podium today is a long way from the rafter seats my wife and I had as college students in Miami in 1972.

Our voters spoke clearly on two critical issues in our primaries: trade and immigration.  They affirmed Donald Trump and his positions.

They oppose Obamatrade.  They demand a lawful system of immigration that protects their safety and their financial well-being.

Average Americans have been the first to know something is wrong with this economy.

Our middle class is steadily declining, with our African American and Hispanic communities being hurt the most.  But, the Washington establishment, the media, and big corporations have been in denial.

Fellow Republicans, we must understand that the incomes of middle class Americans today are $4,186 per year less than in 1999.

This is an economic disaster.  We are on the wrong track and the people know it.

Yet, Hillary Clinton’s plan is more of the same: more government, more taxes, more regulation, more immigration, and more debt.

She has been a champion of globalist trade agreements. But the facts are in. They have not worked for our people.  When those agreements were signed, Presidents Clinton and Obama promised our dangerous trade deficits with Chinaand Korea would be reduced.  But, the deficit with China has increased five-fold and the deficit with Korea doubled. These are job-killing numbers.  Worst of all, they are now pushing the disastrous 5,554-page Obamatrade – the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.

This election has also been about immigration.  For 30 years, our good people have rightly pleaded for an end to the lawlessness, and for sound immigration policies that are fair and advance the national interest.

To this legitimate plea, our elites have responded with disdain, dismissal, and scorn.

But is there anyone in America that does not understand that when we bring in more workers than we have jobs for that job prospects and wages will fall? Top economists and the Congressional Budget Office have told us that.  Is it too much to ask that we slow down and protect our national security and jobs?

Let’s consider the facts.  We lawfully admit 1.1 million permanent residents annually, more than any other country.  In addition, we have 700,000 foreign guest workers taking jobs.

The majority of these are not seasonal or agricultural.  There are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year, and almost 500,000 more unlawfully overstay their visas.  These are extreme numbers.  But the only solution from Obama and Hillary Clinton is to capitulate to the lawlessness and give amnesty and citizenship to all.

Understand this.  From 2000 to 2014, while our existing population increased by millions, the number of jobs held by Americans actually declined.

Amazingly, all the net job growth during that period went to immigrants.  Combine that with the reality of efficient businesses, robots, and slow growth.

The fact is, we don’t have enough jobs for the people who are here.  Doesn’t this help to explain why our wages have fallen and why we have the lowest percentage of Americans actually holding a job in 40 years?  Our duty as elected officials is to get our people jobs first.

It cannot be our policy to have workers from abroad take jobs while we provide support payments for unemployed Americans.

Bad trade deals close factories, and end high paying jobs.  Excess immigration floods the labor market reducing jobs and wages.

Improper vetting places our nation at risk of terrorism.  Remember, the President has the clear power to “suspend” immigration to protect America.

Americans want help now. This election will make it happen.

That is why we need Donald Trump.

Donald Trump is the leader that will bring change.

He has the strength, courage, and will to get it done.  He is attracting more and more Independents and Democrats to our movement.

Donald Trump will kill Obamatrade.

Donald Trump will build the wall.

DONALD TRUMP WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Rudy Giuliani,"I am here to speak to you about how to make America safe.

The vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe.  They fear for their children and they fear for themselves.

They fear for our police officers who are being targeted.

We pray for our police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge and their families; And we say thank you to the Cleveland Police Department for protecting us and all police officers protecting all of us.

We also reach out with understanding and compassion to those who have lost loved ones because of police shootings unjustified and justified.

It’s time to make America safe again.

It’s time to make America ONE again.

I know it can be done because I did it by changing New York City from ‘the crime capital of America’ to according to the FBI the safest large city in America.

What I did for New York City…….

Donald Trump WILL do for America.

I have known Donald Trump for almost 30 years. And he has created and accomplished great things.   But beyond that this is a man with a big heart.

Every time New York City suffered a tragedy, Donald Trump was there to help.

And he did it anonymously. (I bet that’s a surprise)

You deserve to know this personal side about our next President.  He has been a great father, father-in-law, grandfather and friend to me and my family.

He will keep us safe and help us achieve and embrace our greatness.

In the last seven months, there have been five major Islamic extremist terrorists attacks on us and our allies.  We must not be afraid to define our enemy;



 It is Islamic extremist terrorism.

'I did not say all of Islam.

I said Islamic extremist terrorism.

Failing to identify them properly maligns decent Muslims around the world.

It also sets up a fear of being politically incorrect that can have serious consequences. And it has.

This is why our enemies see us as weak and vulnerable.

Donald Trump has said the first step in defeating our enemies is to identify them properly and see the connections between them.

To defeat Islamic extremist terrorism we must put them on defense.If they are at war against us — which they have declared — we must commit ourselves to unconditional victory against them.

This includes undoing one of the worst deals America ever made – Obama’s Nuclear Agreement with Iran that will eventually let them become a nuclear power and put billions of dollars back into a country that the world’s biggest state sponsor of terrorism.

Donald Trump will make sure that any agreement with Iran meets the original goals of the U.N and our allies: a non-nuclear Iran.

Donald Trump is a leader.  He will reassert America’s position as the nation with the best values to lead the world.

It was Hillary Clinton who advocated for the overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya.

Now Libya is in chaos.

Hillary Clinton is accountable for this and much more.

Her dereliction of duty and failure to keep her people safe played a major role in the horrific Islamic terrorist murders on September 11-12, 2012 in Benghazi which claimed the lives of four brave Americans; our Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith, and CIA agents Tyrone S. Woods, and Glen Doherty.

And Clinton, and the Obama administration, for political reasons lied about the purpose of the attacks including her lying directly to the families of those who were killed.

Hillary Clinton’s answer to Congress about the death of these four brave Americans because of her failures as Secretary of State was “what difference at this point does it make?”

Watch the video for yourself and see the arrogant disregard for American lives lost unnecessarily.  Make up your own mind.

Anyone who can say that it makes no difference how or why people serving America are killed, should not be entrusted with the awesome responsibility to protect them and us and should not be allowed to be our Commander in Chief.

Who would trust her to protect them?

I do not.

Do you?

Donald Trump will change all of that.

In short he will lead by leading, not by following.

You know Donald Trump will secure our borders
His opponent has had her chance to do this and failed. Hillary Clinton is for open borders.

She is in favor of taking in Syrian refugees even though the Islamic state  has told us they are going to put their operatives in these groups so they can carry out terrorist acts against us and our allies.

We can’t afford to repeat the mistakes of the past.

Hillary Clinton’s experience is the basis for her campaign.  Well, Hillary Clinton’sexperience is exactly the reason she should not be our president.

There is no more time for us left to revive our great country.  No more time to repeat our mistakes of the past.

Washington needs a complete turnaround and Donald Trump is the agent of change and he will be the leader of the change we need.

He will make America, like the president I worked for Ronald Reagan, once again be the shining City on the Hill.

Vote for Donald Trump for a safer America and for an America headed in a different direction………Greatness!  God Bless the United States of America.

Joni Ernst,"Distinguished delegates, Republicans, and millions of my fellow Americans watching around the country, especially those in Iowa: it’s an honor to be with you from Cleveland, and to be on this stage with fellow veterans. Among them are Special Operations Master Sargent Jason Beardsley, and my colleague, Congressman and Navy SEAL Ryan Zinke, who you’ll hear from shortly.

I never would have imagined a small town girl like me, from Red Oak would have the opportunity to serve as the first woman elected to federal office from Iowa: however, my parents always said to my brother, sister, and me that if we worked hard, anything was possible.

Growing up, we didn’t have much, but what we didn’t have in money, my parents, particularly my mom, made up for with tenacity.

She really encouraged us: you’d never hear her say “no you can’t do this.” Instead, if something was challenging, she’d say “Joni, we’ll figure out a way. If this is what you want, let’s make it happen: we’ll figure it out together.”

That’s a trait I carry with me today, and it’s something I teach my own daughter. In our household, and in the homes of many of those in the military, including those up here tonight, giving up, quitting or accepting failure are not options.

That resilience is not unique to our house: that “can do” attitude has served as the foundation of our country for 240 years. It continues tonight here in Ohio, inIowa, and all around our great nation.

In between my freshman and sophomore years in college, I went on an agricultural exchange to the Soviet Union. At night, the Ukrainians didn’t talk about farming: rather, they wanted to know what it was like to live in a country where they could experience freedom. They wanted to know about our country, a place where anything was possible.

When I came home, I realized it wasn’t enough to simply enjoy freedom and liberty: I had to do my part to protect and preserve it. So I joined the military which as those of us up here with me know is a tremendously important institution that defends the freedoms that we Americans cherish.

I’ve had the great privilege of serving my state and our country while working alongside some of our nation’s finest soldiers. For 14 months I served as a company commander during Operation Iraqi Freedom where my unit was tasked with running convoys through Kuwait and southern Iraq. Last November, after more than 23 years of service, I retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard.

As I travel across Iowa and around our great country, I hear from folks who are worried America is no longer leading, but rather following from behind.

Those concerns are echoed by our allies around the world, and rightfully so.

The question I hear time and again is “where is America’s leadership?” There’s a void in the world: a deficit that cannot be filled by others. Our country and the world of which we are a part simply cannot afford four more years of this lack of leadership under Hillary Clinton.

Our allies see us shrinking from our place as a leader in the world as we have failed time and again to address threats. They are looking for American leaders who are willing to stand up and say ‘enough is enough.’

Unfortunately, Hillary Clinton cannot be trusted. Her judgment and character are not suited to be sitting in the most powerful office in the world.

She has already failed us too many times before.

Hillary Clinton has failed to stop the expansion of terrorism—her policies inLibya, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria have created more safe havens for terrorism. Shockingly, she continues to support a policy that brings captured terrorists into our back yards. All of us up here believe that’s unacceptable.

Hillary Clinton has failed to support our allies—her decision to back the Irannuclear deal puts in peril our longtime friends and allies in the region, especiallyIsrael. They have continued to threaten to destroy Israel, both directly and indirectly through its terrorist proxies, such as Hezbollah. They remain the top sponsor of terrorism, which endangers not just Israel, but Europe and the United States.

And look at the pathetic track record she and Obama have in the war on ISIS. This administration has called them junior varsity adversaries, ignoring some of the best advice they were given. They represent a threat that is not limited to theMiddle East, and which is spreading rapidly. In fact, according to the FBI, ISIS is present in all 50 states. Think about that for a moment. Terrorists from ISIS are in every one of our 50 states.  They will use whatever weapons they have: guns, trucks, knives, poisons, and bombs to kill innocent people.

Under this current administration’s wayward policies, ISIS continues to spread, while the President fails to put forward a comprehensive strategy to defeat and destroy them.

Yet Hillary Clinton has failed to protect our national security in other ways. She jeopardized our safety by deciding our laws don’t apply to her, setting up her own private e-mail server, and then lying about how it was used.

Our men and women of the armed services do not fail us: they cannot. The veterans beside me did not fail us: they too are individuals of the highest integrity. Our presidents cannot fail us either: how can we accept Hillary Clintonwhen she has failed them, failed us, and cannot be trusted? She has proven time and again that she is entirely unfit to serve our nation as Commander-in-Chief.

For too long Americans have felt abandoned, and their warnings unheard. Donald Trump has heard these voices loud and clear. We cannot afford four more years of the same failed policies.

If that is not enough, the Veteran’s Administration has been failing those who have served alongside those of us here on stage with me tonight, with scandal after scandal at the highest levels. Inferior care, long wait times, extraordinary inefficiency, and a bureaucracy that has gone wild still continues.

We need a commander-in-chief who will stand up to our enemies and stand up for our veterans. We need a leader who will ensure America remains a strong, stabilizing force around the globe, and who will keep us safe here at home.

Our country cannot take another four years just like the eight we’ve just had. It is time to stand up and fight for the security of our children, our grandchildren, and ourselves.

With Hillary Clinton it’s always about her, when it should be about you. Donald Trump is focused on you. He gave voice to a movement of millions of Americans who are tired of politics as usual, and I know as president he will work tirelessly to keep our nation safe.

Now is the time to make America safe again.

Thank you, and may God bless all of you, the wonderful state of Iowa, our brave men and women in uniform, and these great United States of America.

Jason Beardsley,"Good evening Cleveland.  I’m proud to be on stage tonight with other dedicated service people, including Senator Ernst and Representative Zinke.

As an elite soldier, I operated at times as the only American in the midst of enemies. Still, no matter how dangerous the mission –– I never lost my conviction that America was the world’s best hope for good.

This same conviction can sustain this nation when we find ourselves imperiled. And this is such a time.

From 9/11, to Russian aggression, to belligerent China, to the evil Islamic State, we face unparalleled threats.

We stand here on the shoulders of giants and legends who gave us this American Republic.  We think of those who pioneered this country with courage and honor through a bloody revolution, and those who gave their lives for the cause of freedom around the world.

Today, at this crucial point in our history, can we summon the spirit that forged our nation and bound us together under principles of liberty and justice for all?  It’s time for us once again to choose freedom over tyranny.

Over the last eight years, the US has traded her role of active leadership for that of a passive observer. Americans have been told that the US has not always been a force for good. That since we have made mistakes, we should forfeit our leadership or “lead from behind.”

This thinking has endangered not just the US but freedom across the world.  The results fall squarely on the shoulders of the current administration, supported byHillary Clinton.

Her leadership was absent as US Marines were forced to smash their weapons while bureaucrats abandoned our embassy in Yemen.  It was absent as enemies overran our consulate and killed four Americans in Benghazi.  This so-called leadership thanked our enemies in Iran while our sailors were on their knees.

It’s time we put someone in office who holds the same conviction that we hold, that my fellow warrior heroes and I hold, and that my friends bled and died for.

As service members, we live by these convictions. Imagine a country where our President shares those convictions and upholds the honor of our military, knows our past and defends liberty.  With that leadership, we will go over the top and into the teeth of the 21 century.

In Donald Trump’s America, we will have that leadership and the only time service members will get on their knees will be to thank their God that they are Americans.

",2016,republican
Ryan Zinke,"I’m honored to be sharing a stage with Senator Ernst, Jason Beardsley, and these distinguished fellow veterans.

What a circle of honor.

I proudly represent the state of Montana in the House.

Before being elected to Congress, I spent 23 years as a U. S. Navy SEAL, and was a commander at SEAL Team Six.

When my daughter was growing up, I told her two things: Don’t join the Navy and never marry a SEAL. She ignored me and did both.

Ever heard of a place called Gitmo?  Let’s just say that I’m personally acquainted with many of the individuals now experiencing those accommodations.

We heard from Marcus Luttrell. Ever hear of Chris Kyle, Rob O’Neill, Glenn Doherty and Ty Woods? I had the privilege of working with Marcus and these other American heroes.  I mentored many more whose names you will never know.

Success as a Navy SEAL depends on three factors.

The first is teamwork. You need to know with certainty the guy behind you literally has your back.

The second is training.  Warfighters going into dangerous places need the skills, expertise, and the rules of engagement to complete no-fail missions.

Lastly: Never Quit.

Without teamwork, training, and never quitting, successful missions, like the one that killed Osama Bin Laden, aren’t possible.

And, when we don’t do things right in dangerous situations, bad things happen.

In January, Army Green Beret Matthew McClintock lost his life in Afghanistan, when his unit came under heavy Taliban fire.

Commanders on the ground requested air support.  None came.

This tragedy represents the weakness we have come to expect from armchair quarterbacks Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Senator Ernst ably described Hillary Clinton’s leadership failures. But the buck stops with the president.

For President Obama, being popular is more important than being Commander in Chief.

He abandoned Iraq. He drew a red line in Syria and then refused to enforce it.

He reached a naïve nuclear arms agreement with Iran – a country where people chant “Death to America” in the street.

He watched passively as China and Russia filled the international leadership vacuum he created. The world knows our president is weak, and that his anointed successor, the architect of Benghazi, is no better.

Together Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton brought us ISIS and brought down Benghazi. I shudder to think what she will bring if she is sitting in the Oval Office.

I have been to too many funerals. Casualties are inevitable in war. But the lives ofSergeant McClintock and four Americans in Benghazi could have been saved with leadership in the White House.

Donald Trump isn’t afraid to talk about radical Islamic terrorism, and he won’t be afraid to destroy it.

We need a Commander in Chief who will support our troops rather than abandon them in Benghazi.

We need a Commander in Chief who will put veterans in front of the line rather than let them die in line

And we need a Commander in Chief who will stand with Israel rather than fund Iranian rockets that attack Israel.

It’s time to rally behind our troops. It’s time to rally behind our nominee. Donald Trump will make America lead again.

Thank you!

As I look around this room at the different delegations…I understand the responsibility each of us has…we need Ohio…my home state of Florida… Pennsylvania… Wisconsin… and each and every state to deliver on Election Day if we are going to save America.

Because just consider for a minute…what would America look like with Hillary Clinton as President?

Our military would have a Commander-in-Chief who has already lied to the families of American soldiers on how…and why…they died in Benghazi.

People who create jobs would continue to be punished…our small businesses would suffer…industries would be destroyed as our fellow Americans across this country continue to lose their jobs.

Honesty…integrity…and ethics would now be taught in history class…because if crooked Hillary is in charge, those values would in fact…become HISTORY.  Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her simply because she will MAKE history.  But Mrs. Clinton, we don’t call that history….we call that  HYPOCRISY!

She repeatedly plays the gender card. In fact she boasts….”deal me in.”

Well Mrs. Clinton consider yourself dealt in. As a Senator you paid women staffers LESS than men.

As Secretary of State you lied to the mothers, daughters, and sisters of men who gave their life for our

As head of a Foundation you accepted TENS OF MILLIONS of dollars from foreign countries who enslave women and treat them as second-class citizens.

As a mother…and grandmother…you have no problem supporting policies that terminate the life of the unborn.

And as First Lady you viciously attacked the character of women who were victims of sexual abuse…at the hands of your husband.

I want to see a woman become President one day and I want my GRANDDAUGHTERS to see a woman President..but not that woman…Hillary Clinton…not now…not EVER. America deserves a President they can trust. A President who is worthy of being Commander-in-Chief…a President who tells the truth. A President who doesn’t look directly in a camera and lie to the American public about our fallen soldiers.

There is no question – Donald J. Trump is better for my children…my grandchildren…and better for this country than Hillary Clinton could EVER be.

As the citizen activists that our Founding Fathers expected us to be…let’s join together in the fight to save our country for the next generation.

Let’s stand together as daughters and sons of liberty and fight the oppressive government of Hillary Clinton by electing Donald J. Trump as our next President of the greatest country in the world.

Dana White,"Good evening.

I’m Dana White, president of the UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship. You might be wondering why I’m here.

I’m not a politician. I’m a fight promoter.

To be honest, I was surprised to be invited, but I was honored, and I wanted to show up to tell you about my friend, the Donald Trump that I know.

In 2001, when my partners and I bought the UFC, it was considered a blood sport.

State athletic commissions didn’t support us.  Arenas around the world refused to host our events. Nobody took us seriously.

Nobody….… except Donald Trump.

Donald was the first guy that recognized the potential that we saw in the UFC… and encouraged us to build our business.

He hosted our first two events at his venue. He dealt with us personally.

He got in the trenches with us… and made a deal that worked for everyone. And he showed up to the fights and sat in the front row. Yeah, he’s that guy. He shows up.

Donald championed the UFC before it was popular, before it grew into the successful business that it is now. I will always be grateful to him for standing with us in those early days.

So tonight, I’m standing with Donald Trump.

Let me tell you three things I respect about this man.

First, Donald has great business instincts. He supports businesses of all sizes.

He’ll make it possible for them to grow and succeed, which is the backbone of a strong economy.

Second, Donald is a hard worker.

He will roll up his sleeves, he will work with people, and put in the time to get things done.

And third, for over 15 years, Donald Trump has been a loyal… and supportive… friend.

I know that if I need him, he’ll be there for me, just like he was when we first met. Sometimes he’ll call just to say, “Hey Dana, I’ll be watching the fights this weekend. Good luck,” … and he’s always reached out when something good happens in my career.

In 2011, we signed a huge network TV deal with FOX, and there was a big write-up about it in the New York Times.

Donald sent me the article and wrote on the front of it, “Congratulations Dana, I always knew you would do it.”

And just for the record, Donald and I are not business partners. His interest in me and my business is personal.

You can really tell a person’s true character when they are happy for someone else’s success.

And I think that sense of loyalty and commitment will translate into how he will run this country.  And let’s honest, we need someone who believes in this  country.

We need someone who is proud of this country, who will fight for this  country.

Let me tell you something: I have been in the fight business my whole life.  I know fighters.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Donald Trump is a fighter. And I know Donald Trump will fight for this country. Thank you.

Governor Asa Hutchinson,"Ladies and gentlemen, I hail from the great state of Arkansas; we know from personal experience that we don’t need Hillary Clinton in the White House.

I have been in the public arena during the administration of six Presidents.

From federal prosecutor under President Reagan; to Congress; and then Homeland Security after 9/11, I have seen America at its best and I have seen America put to the test.

There has never been a more urgent time for leadership.

—–America’s strength and boldness are desperately needed on the world stage.

——and a new energy is demanded at home to build our economy and to defeat terrorism.

Strength, boldness and new energy are not words that describe Hillary Clinton. This is the same Hillary we knew in Arkansas and later in Washington for so many years. Hillary always wanted more government, and her dreams have only gotten bigger.

Regretfully, she offers more of the same. The same uncertain leadership in fighting terrorism;

The same failed….top down approach to health care….where Washington tells the states what to do;

The same nanny state regulations that strangle the economic strength of America. If you like the last 8 years, then Hillary will give you double for  your trouble!

But good things are happening in the states. In Arkansas, we are creating jobs and leading in computer science education.

Unemployment is the lowest in the recorded history of Arkansas and we have a$177 million surplus.   We can do better in our country.

We need a President that values the role of the states, will destroy ISIS, and jump-start our economy.

Experience matters.

On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton emphasizes her experience. Yes.  Experience matters.  But judgment matters more.

Despite her experience, Hillary Clinton’s poor decisions have produced bad results.

Just think about it

Hillary Clinton’s radical attempts at so-called “reform” of the nation’s healthcare system would have been more destructive than even Obamacare has been.

Hillary Clinton’s bad judgment, as you heard last night, left us four dead Americans in Benghazi.

It resulted in instability in Egypt, Syria and Libya; the rise of ISIS; the resurgence of Russia; an emboldened North Korea; inappropriate ties between foreign governments and the Clinton Foundation; and a more dangerous  world.

When it comes to being Commander in Chief, we don’t want a President who in the words of the FBI is “extremely careless” in the handling of classified material.

Donald Trump represents a different kind of leadership. He is exactly the kind of transparent, straight-talking leader America needs right  now.

A Hillary Clinton presidency will endanger our national security.  IT:

—-will be the wrong direction for our economy

—-and will undermine the innovation coming from the states. A Trump Presidency will be about the art of the possible.

Donald Trump is the right leader for our time. Thank you.

Lt. Gov Leslie Rutledge,"Good evening. Sometimes, Hillary Clinton has a New York accent. Sometimes, anArkansas accent.

But y’all….this is what a real Arkansas woman sounds like.

Hillary may not know where she’s from, but Arkansans know exactly who she is. Arkansans know who I am.

Raised on a cattle farm, married to a row crop farmer, I’m a Christian, pro-life, gun- carrying, conservative woman.

And, the first female Republican elected Attorney General of Arkansas.

The very same office Bill Clinton held when those two launched their careers of corruption.

Hillary says they were poor when they left the White House.

And while they’ve made millions, she’s still poor in all the ways that really count: poor judgment, poor policies and poor decisions. Hillary is a lawyer, but she acts like the law doesn’t apply to her.

Absolutely no good could have come from merging her public service with her private interests…much less her private  server.

What we know about her scandals is bad. What we don’t know may be worse.

Why did Bill’s speaking fees skyrocket as soon as she was Secretary of State? Why did donors to the Clinton Foundation receive favorable treatment from the State Department?  Deception and dishonesty are all second nature to  Hillary.

As my daddy likes to say, she will lie [even] when the truth would serve her better.

Let’s face it: That woman has more baggage than Chicago O’Hare. I broke a glass ceiling.

I know the importance of doing so.

But, a historical milestone need not come at the expense of America. Unlike Hillary, Donald Trump knows that women – and men – are not single issue voters.

We care about jobs, the economy and national security.

As Attorney General, I know this race will shape the Supreme Court for generations.

Do we want the great Antonin Scalia to be replaced by a liberal activist judge? Donald Trump will nominate conservative justices who will uphold the Constitution, support the rule of law and rein in out-of-control federal  bureaucrats.

Frankly, Hillary needs to go to her own house, not the White House…and takeRuth Bader Ginsberg with her.

My fellow Americans, it’s time to update your resumes because Donald Trump is growing jobs and putting America back to work.

With Donald Trump as President….America will be closed to overregulation and open for business.

God bless each of you and God Bless America.

",2016,republican
Michael Mukasey,"Over the years, Hillary Clinton has done a lot and said a lot to show why she should not be president.

But how she treated government secrets as Secretary of State, and what she said before and after she was caught, sums up the case against her.

She sent and received secret, and top-secret, and beyond-top-secret emails on an unsecure private email system instead of on the secure government system – and she did it without authorization.

She said – falsely – that there was no classified information. She said –  falsely – that what she did was authorized.

And what else did she say – falsely? She said, “When we traveled to sensitive places like Russia, we often received warnings from department security officials  to leave our blackberrys, laptops – anything that communicated with the outside world – on the plane, with their batteries removed to prevent foreign intelligence services from compromising them.” She said, “Even in friendly settings we conducted business under strict security precautions, taking care when and how  we read secret material and used our technology.” That’s from her book. The title  of the book — ironically – is “hard choices.”

In reality, we now know that she chose to use her private email overseas, in countries hostile to the United States and that have sophisticated hacking capability. Although her system was so remarkably primitive the FBI could not figure out whether or not it had been hacked, we know that the emails of people with whom she communicated were hacked.

About her emails we have to ask ourselves the infamous question that  she asked about the death of four Americans in Benghazi – “what difference, at this point, does it make?”

Well, it makes a big difference.

This is the only country in the world that was founded on a law – the Constitution.

Hillary is running for an office – the presidency — whose powers and duties are defined by that law. The most important power that law gives the president is to be commander in chief of the armed forces – to protect the  country.

That law imposes on the president the duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” That law – the Constitution – specifically requires that before taking up those powers and duties, the president swear to “faithfully execute” the office, and “preserve, protect and defend” the  Constitution.

Hillary Clinton took a similar oath before she became secretary of state.

What that means is that Hillary Clinton is asking us, as Americans, to make her the first president to take the oath of office after already violating that  oath.

Our message for anyone watching these proceedings should be simple:  NO WAY

Andy Wist,"Thank you.  It’s great to be here.

It’s been a lot of fun the last few days watching the media speculate about me.

Who’s “Andy Wist?” they all asked.

Somebody said I was Batman.

That’s Adam West, dummy!

Some of these reporters need to get a life!

Look, you want to know who Andy Wist is?

I’ll tell you. I’m living proof that the American Dream is  real.

I grew up in Brooklyn and started a business in my mother’s backyard when I was 21… Standard Waterproofing.

We restore building exteriors.

Today we have 140 employees.

Not as big as Mr. Trump’s company, but still pretty good, right?

I’m also the trustee of Teamsters Local 522, because like Donald Trump and Mike Pence, I believe that working men and women still matter in this country and we have to look out for them.

After 8 years of President Obama, I don’t see the American Dream like I did when  I was starting out.

All I see is too many people out of work… too many jobs shipped overseas… and too many politicians who don’t care.

It’s a mess

Who’s going to fix it?

Hillary Clinton?

After 30 years in public life her only accomplishment is beating the rap every time she breaks the law.

Donald Trump is a builder.

He’s a leader who will bring us together

He’ll make America work again, so we can believe again.

I’m not a big important person.  I’m just a regular  guy.

I love my family.

I love my country.

I’ve lived a great life.

But I’m not going to be around forever. Neither will you.

This November, we get to decide what kind of world we leave  behind.

When I’m gone, I want my children, your children, and our grandchildren to be able to live the American Dream like I have.

And the only way we keep the American Dream alive is by electing Donald Trump president.

Thank you!

",2016,republican
Senator Ron Johnson,"What difference, at this point, does it make? I am the guy that provoked that infamous response from Hillary Clinton by asking a pretty simple question: “Why didn’t you just pick up the phone and call the survivors?”

But instead of doing that, she hatched her cover-up story and repeatedly lied to the American people.  She even lied to the surviving family members of America’s fallen heroes. Think about that for a moment.

And, of course, Hillary’s cold, calculated lying continues. If we can’t trust her to tell us the truth, how can we possibly trust her to lead America?

So let me tell you — and Hillary Clinton — what difference it does makes when America’s leaders cannot be trusted — when our commander in chief fails miserably by employing a strategy of peace through withdrawal instead of achieving peace through strength.

It makes a difference to the young Yazidi woman I met who was captured and brutalized by ISIS barbarians, the joy of life hauntingly absent in her eyes.

It makes a difference to the travelers, passing through airports in Brussels andIstanbul, who just wanted to get home to their family and friends.

It makes a difference to the ordinary Americans sharing holiday cheer at a Christmas party in San Bernardino.

It makes a difference to the young men and women dancing on a summer night at a club in Orlando.

And it makes a difference to the families watching fireworks at a celebration of freedom in Nice.

These are just a few examples of Islamic terrorists, let me repeat that — ISLAMIC TERRORISTS — slaughtering and brutalizing their innocent  victims.

When will America effectively respond to this terrible reality? We certainly won’t if Democrats win in November.

In Wisconsin, I’m running against Russ Feingold, who, even after 9/11, voted against giving law enforcement the tools they need to help stop international terror. During his eighteen year Senate career, he also voted against authorizing our military eleven separate times. And now he’s asking Wisconsinites to give him a fourth term — just as Hillary Clinton is asking America to give her Obama’s third term.

The world is simply too dangerous to elect either of them. Instead, America needs strong leadership.

Leaders who will jumpstart our economy, secure our borders, strengthen our military, and accomplish the goal President Obama set over twenty-two months ago: We must defeat ISIS, and then remain fully committed to destroying Islamic terrorists wherever they hide.

It doesn’t have to be like this — we shouldn’t have to live in fear.

This is a fight for freedom.

It’s not someone else’s fight, this is our fight. And it is a fight we absolutely must win.

Donald Trump and Mike Pence understand that these must be America’s top priorities.

They will be strong leaders, working with Republicans in the House and Senate to achieve a goal that can unite us all: A safe, prosperous, and secure  America.

Our future hangs in the balance.

We must unify, work tirelessly, and together, save this great nation.

So God Bless your efforts, and God Bless America.

Chris Cox,"I want to talk to you tonight about a very personal freedom: your right to protect your life.

Because as much as we don’t like to think about it…we live in dangerous times.

We’re worried, and we have reason to be.

Because we know government has failed to keep us safe.

You have to be able to protect yourself and your family. And that’s what the Second Amendment is all about.

Imagine a young mother at home with her baby, when a violent predator kicks in the door.         He’s a three-time loser who never should have been  released from prison early. But he was, because some politician wanted to show their “compassion”.  So what’s she going to do?

She’ll dial 911…and pray. The police will do their absolute best to get there quickly.  But their average response time is 11 minutes.

Should she be able to defend herself with a firearm in her own home? My fellow Americans, that question is on the ballot in  November.

Here’s why.

Eight years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that we have a fundamental, individual right to protect ourselves and our families with a firearm in our own homes.

They should’ve ruled it nine-to-nothing, but the Second Amendment survived by just one vote. After Justice Scalia’s death, that vote is  gone.

Here’s where Hillary Clinton stands.

She said, quote, “the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.”

Think about that. All the Supreme Court said was you have the right to protect your life in your own home. Hillary says they got it wrong.  It’s that simple…a Hillary Clinton Supreme Court means your right to own a firearm is  gone.

Make no mistake: this election isn’t about the next four years. It’s about the next forty years, so voting for Hillary Clinton, or not voting, is simply not an option.

What’s so outrageous is that for the rest of her life, Hillary Clinton will never even think about dialing 9-1-1.

For thirty years, she hasn’t taken a walk, a nap or a bathroom break without a good guy with a gun there to protect her.

So it’s easy for her to dismiss a right she will never have to use.  But for the rest of us, the choice to own a firearm is ours to  make.

And in America, there cannot be one set of rules for the Clintons, and  another set for us.

But here’s Hillary’s problem.

American women are the fastest-growing group of gun owners. Millions own firearms.  And millions more are thinking about it.  It’s not Hillary Clinton who says women should have that choice. It’s Donald Trump.

Donald Trump is a life member of the NRA…and so are his sons, Don and Eric…because we’re the largest and oldest civil rights organization in  America.

We fight for the rights of all Americans, regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation…because the right to protect your life is the most precious right  you have.

If you agree…you have to vote for Donald Trump.

If you believe women have the right to choose to own a firearm for themselves, you HAVE to vote for Donald Trump.

Friends, the 5 million men and women of the NRA will fight without apology for your right to protect your life.

But we are on the cusp of losing this great American freedom…and with it…this great nation.

The only way we save it, the only way we save it is by electing Donald Trump the next President of the United States.

Natalie Gulbis,"Thank you.

I appreciate this incredible opportunity to speak to you about a man that I greatly admire … a man I have found to be gracious, generous, and inspiring.

I must begin, however, by saying there is a great deal of irony that I am speaking to you tonight because when I earned my Tour Card sixteen years ago, I was told there’s only two things you don’t talk about in public: Faith … and politics.

Well, tonight, I am prepared to violate both those admonitions as I stand before you at the Republican National Convention as a Christian woman.

I believe that God’s timing is perfect: He puts people in our lives to help us make a positive impact on those around us… and to help us achieve our goals.

One of those people for me, is Donald Trump.

The first time I played golf with him in 2005, I shared two things that I’d told countless CEOs, billionaires, and politicians before him: One, I had a dream to open up a Boys and Girls Club; and two, I was deeply frustrated about being treated differently as a woman … overlooked and underpaid in business.

These words previously fell on deaf, all-be-it well-intentioned ears … but that day was different.

They finally fell on ears that cared enough to take action.

I’m proud to tell you, that with Donald’s help, I opened up the Natalie Gulbis, Boys and Girls Club.

In response to my frustrations about being treated unfairly as a woman, he adamantly rejected that notion… and instead, offered me a simple idea that changed my life forever: “Never fear challenging the status quo.”

He’s encouraged me to think of myself not as a female athlete, but as a business person.

“In everything you do, be fearless,” he’d remind me. “Be fearless.”

As an athlete, fearlessness came naturally to me; but as a business woman, I faced challenges that weren’t always on a level playing field. Even today, I face challenges and Donald remains a consistent voice encouraging me to stand up to gender injustices and to LEAN IN to any professional challenges that come my way.

I hope you take these principles about generosity and fearlessness… and that they can have a similar impact for you in your life… like they have had in mine.

Ronald Reagan said, “Status quo is Latin for the mess we’re in.”

And while I believe that this is the greatest time to be a woman in the greatest country in the history of the world, I have no delusions that there isn’t a mess to clean up … and we desperately need someone to clean up this mess.

That person is Donald Trump.

If one’s history of fearlessness and challenging the status quo is an indicator for meaningful progress, then Donald Trump is the person to bring that to America.

Thank you

",2016,republican
Senator Mitch McConnell,"Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve been around a while.

And I’ve been around the Clintons more than anybody should ever have to. A couple years ago, Bill and Hillary camped out in my state telling anybody who’d listen why they ought to vote against me. Tonight I’m here to return the favor.

I am a patient man. As a young child in the South, I was struck with polio and forced to stay off my feet for two years.

That experience taught me an abiding gratitude for my parents. And it taught me how to wait, which comes in handy when you’re leading the U.S. Senate.

More than anything, though, my job has taught me the value of trust … how to distinguish between people who are in this to serve others and people who are in it for themselves.

I am here to tell you Hillary Clinton will say anything, do anything, and be anything to get elected president.

And we cannot allow it.

The American People are tired of hearing about the bounty of government while the cost of caring for a family or meeting daily expenses grows out of  reach.

Over the past few years, they’ve seen government officials abuse their office and get rewarded for it.   They’ve seen the middle class  shrink.

And in the midst of all this they have raised a simple complaint. Who is looking out for us?

It is not Hillary…

I’ve had my differences with Barack Obama, but l will give him this. At least he was up front about his plans to move America to the  left.

Not Hillary…

She lied about her emails. She lied about her server. She lied about Benghazi. She lied about sniper fire.

She even lied about why her parents named her Hillary. So I ask a simple question.

At a moment when so many feel betrayed by their government.

Why in the world would Democrats put forward such a candidate?

Hillary has changed her positions so many times it’s impossible to tell where conviction ends and ambition begins.

In 2010, she said Iran could enrich uranium. In 2014 she said she’s always argued against it.

Once a backer of the Keystone pipeline, last year she opposed it. She used to be against sanctuary cities.

Then she claimed to be for them.  Who knows where she is now.

Friends, not since Baghdad Bob has there been a public figure with such a tortured relationship with the truth.

There is a clear choice before us. And it is not Hillary.

You know what the next four years will look like with Hillary.

And you know that if Hillary is president, we will continue to slide, distracted  by the scandals that follow the Clintons like flies.

Two years ago, voters delivered a clear verdict on the Obama years by   sending a freshmen class of rock star Republicans to the Senate and delivering us a majority that I promised to make you proud of.

We’d never hesitate to confront this President.

But we’d also do the hard work of tackling urgent problems head on. We have delivered on that promise.

We put an Obamacare repeal bill on the President’s desk.  He vetoed  it.

Trump would sign it.

We passed a bill to finally build the Keystone Pipeline.  He vetoed it.

Trump would sign it.

We passed a bill to defund Planned Parenthood. Obama vetoed it. Trump would sign it.

And on that sad day when we lost the great Antonin Scalia, I made another pledge that Barack Obama would not fill this seat. That honor will go to Donald Trump.

With Donald Trump in the White House, Senate Republicans will build on the work we’ve done and pass more bills into law than any  Senate in years.

We passed the first major education reform in more than a decade, and ended common core.

We made the first significant reforms to Social Security in three decades. We passed a crucial cybersecurity bill.

We imposed sanctions on North Korea

We passed the first major highway bill in more than a decade.

We passed a bill to combat the scourge of human trafficking.

And just last week we passed, and the president signed, the first major law aimed at confronting the heartbreaking explosion of opioid and heroin  abuse.

Keep the Senate in Republican hands and we will continue this work.

And the remarkable public servants that I am proud to lead in the Senate will not let you down.

But put Hillary Clinton in the White House and I promise you this.

She will double down on the cynical approach that Senate Democrats seem to revel in these days.

Here’s what I mean.

As we sit here tonight, a terrifying mosquito-borne illness threatens expectant mothers and their babies along the Southern Coast.

And just last week, Clinton Democrats in the Senate blocked a bill aimed at eradicating that virus before it spread.

They blocked a defense funding bill. A bill that would support the brave men and women who are right now defending us overseas.

What do these people think public service is about?  I don’t know.

But I know this. If Hillary Clinton is our president, nothing will change. So tonight, I ask you to let us continue our work.

Let’s put justices on the Supreme Court who cherish our Constitution. Let’s keep the Senate!

And let’s elect a President and Vice President who really believe America is exceptional.

Speaker Paul Ryan,"Thank you all very much.

Delegates, friends, and fellow citizens: I appreciate the privilege of addressing this forty-first convention of the Party of Lincoln.

As part of my co-chairman duties, let me thank all the people of this beautiful city for looking after us this week. And above all I want to thank the men and women here from law enforcement for your service.

You know, standing up here again, it all has a familiar feel. Students of trivia will recall that last time around I was your nominee for vice president. It was a great honor, even if things didn’t work out quite according to plan.

But hey, I’m a positive guy. I’ve found other things to keep me busy. And I like to look at it this way. Next time there’s a State of the Union address, I don’t know where Joe Biden and Barack Obama will be. But you’ll find me right there on the rostrum with Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump.

Democracy is a series of choices. We Republicans have made ours.

Have we had our arguments this year? Sure we have – and you know what I call those? Signs of life. Signs of a party that’s not just going through the motions. Not just mouthing new words for the same old stuff.

Meanwhile, what choice has the other party made, in this incredible year filled with so many surprises?

Here we are, at a time when men and women in both parties so clearly, so undeniably, want a big change in direction for America, a clean break from a failed system. And what does the Democratic Party establishment offer? What is their idea of a clean break?

They are offering a third Obama term, brought to you by another Clinton. And we’re supposed to be excited about that?

For a country so ready for change, it feels like we had been cleared for takeoff, and then somebody announced we’re all going back to the gate.

It’s like we’ve been on hold forever, waiting and waiting to finally talk to a real person, and somehow we’ve been sent back to the main menu.

Watch the Democratic Party convention next week – that four-day infomercial of politically correct moralizing. And let it be a reminder of all that is at stake in this election. You can get through four days of it, with a little help from the mute button. But four more years of it?

Not … a … chance. The Obama years are almost over. The Clinton years are way over.

Two-thousand sixteen is the year America moves on.

# # #

From now to November, we will hear how many different ways progressive elitists can find to talk down to the rest of America … to tell voters that the Obama years have been good for you … that you should be grateful, and now, well, it’s Hillary’s turn.

But the problem is very simple. There is a reason people in our country are disappointed and restless.

If opportunity seems like it’s been slipping away, that’s because it has. And liberal progressive ideas have done exactly nothing to help. Wages never seem to go up.

The whole economy feels stuck. And for millions of Americans, middle-class security is now just a memory.

Progressives like our president talk forever about poverty in America. And if high-sounding talk did any good, we’d have overcome these deep problems long ago.

This explains why, under the most liberal president we’ve had so far, poverty in America is worse – especially for our fellow citizens who were promised better and need it most.

The result is a record of discarded promises … empty gestures … phony strawman arguments … reforms put off forever … shady power plays, like the one that gave us Obamacare … constitutional limits brushed off as nothing … and, all the while, dangers in the world downplayed, even as the threats grow bolder and come closer.

# # #

It’s the latest chapter of an old story: progressives deliver everything except progress.

Yet we know better than to think that Republicans can win only on the failures of Democrats. It still comes down to the contest of ideas. Which is really good news, ladies and gentlemen, because when it’s about ideas, the advantage goes to us.

Against the dreary backdrop of arrogant bureaucracies … pointless mandates … reckless borrowing … willful retreat in the world … and all that progressives still have in store for us, the Republican Party stands as the great, enduring alternative.

We believe in making government, as Ronald Reagan said, not the distributor of gifts and privilege, but once again the protector of our liberties.

Let the other party go on making its case for more government control over every aspect of our lives – more taxes to pay … more debt to carry … more rules to follow … more judges who just make it up as they go along.

We, in this party, are committed to a federal government that acts again as a servant accountable to the people, following the Constitution, and venturing not one inch beyond the consent of the governed.

We, in this party, offer a better way for our country, based on fundamentals that go back to the Founding generation. We believe in a free society where aspiration and effort can make the difference in every life … where your starting point is not your destiny … and where your first chance is not your only chance.

We offer a better way for America, with ideas that actually work. A reformed tax code that rewards free enterprise, instead of just enterprising lobbyists.

A reformed health care system that operates by free choice, instead of by force, and doesn’t leave you answering to cold, clueless bureaucrats.

A renewed commitment to building a 21st-Century military – and to giving our veterans the care they were promised, the care that they have earned.

And we offer a better way of dealing with persistent poverty in this country: A way that shows poor Americans the world beyond liberal warehousing and checkwriting … into the life everyone can find, with opportunity and independence … the happiness of using your gifts, and the dignity of having a job.

And you know what? None of this will happen under Hillary Clinton.

Only with Donald Trump and Mike Pence do we have a chance at a better way.

And, last, let the other party go on and on with its constant dividing up of people … always playing one group against the other, as if group identity were everything.

In America, aren’t we all supposed to see beyond class, or ethnicity, or all those other lines drawn to set us apart and lock us in groups?

Real social progress is always a widening of the circle of concern and protection. It’s respect and empathy overtaking blindness and indifference. It’s understanding that by the true measure we are all neighbors and countrymen – called, each one of us, to know what is right and kind and just, and to go and do likewise.

Everyone is equal … everyone has a place … no one is written off, because there is worth and goodness in every life.

Straight from the Declaration of Independence, that is the Republican ideal – and if we won’t defend it, who will?

# # #

So much that you and I care about, so many things we stand for, are in the balance in the coming election. Whatever we lack going into this campaign, we should not lack for motivation. In the plainest terms I know, it is all on the line.

So let’s act that way. Let’s use the edge we have, because it is still what earns trust and votes. This year of surprises and dramatic turns can end in the finest possible way – when America elects a conservative governing majority.

We can do this, we can earn that mandate, if we don’t hold anything back, if we never lose sight of the stakes. Our candidates will be giving their all, their utmost, and every one of us has got to do the same.

So what do you say we unite this party, at this crucial moment when unity is everything?

Let’s take the fight to our opponents with better ideas – let’s get on the offensive and let’s stay there.

Let’s compete in every part of America, and turn out at the polls like every last vote matters, because it will.

Fellow Republicans, what we have begun here, let’s see it through … let’s win this thing … let’s show America our best and nothing less.

We have listened and you have told us — ENOUGH. ENOUGH of feeling like your government is ignoring you. ENOUGH of Washington bailouts and handouts.

ENOUGH of feeling less safe and less secure in a more dangerous world where the bad guys are winning and the good guys are  losing.

But I have good news — in just one hundred and twelve days — it’s over. In this election the stakes have never been higher.

Do we settle for the path we are on? Or do we take a better way?

Republicans believe that families who work hard should get ahead. Republicans believe in an America that isn’t divided by race — religion — or gender. Republicans believe that America only works if we put your interests above the special interests.

But that’s not what has happened over the past eight years.

For eight years we have had a President who promised us so much but delivered so little.  The lies we were told about Obamacare.

The destruction of jobs and entire industries. The empowerment of Iran and the rise of ISIS.  Republicans have a better way.  We have a plan to fix it.

In our Republican agenda — our enemies will fear us. Our taxes will be fairer.

People can afford the health care they want. The people’s voice will be heard. Government will help those who truly need it and allow everyone an opportunity to rise.

So to all those left behind by economic forces out of your control — we hear you

To those attacked for your beliefs — we hear you!

To a nation that sees chaos spreading across America and across the globe — we hear you. And for our men and women in uniform — we hear you. As a matter of principle you will have the very best America has to  offer.

Those who fought on the front lines should NEVER have to wait in line. There is a better way.

But this Republican agenda can only be realized if we disrupt the status quo. And let’s face it — Hillary Clinton is the definition of the status  quo.

We need a leader who shapes the future.

The Democrats won’t bring that future because they are stuck in the past.

When innovation has brought more power to the people — Democrats want more power for Washington.

When innovation advances technology — Hillary Clinton uses it to put American secrets at risk.

This is not the path for our country.

In these difficult times I remember the words of President Ronald Reagan when he described America as that shining city upon the hill.

Together — by electing a Republican Congress — Donald Trump — and Mike Pence.

We can build a better America and make that shining city upon the hill bright again.

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

Chris Christie,"I am here tonight not only as the Governor of New Jersey, but also as Donald Trump’s friend for the last fourteen years.

We are about to be led by not only a strong leader but by a caring, genuine and decent person.

I am proud to say that the voice of the people of our nation is being heard in this

hall and those voices want Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States. But this election is not just about Donald Trump.

It is also about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

In the past few weeks we have seen this Justice Department refuse to prosecute her.

Over the last eight years, we have seen this Administration refuse to hold her accountable for her dismal record as Secretary of State.

Well, tonight, as a former federal prosecutor, I welcome the opportunity to hold her accountable for her performance and her character.

We must present those facts to you, a jury of her peers, both in this hall and in living rooms around our nation.

Since the Justice Department refuses to allow you to render a verdict, let’s present the case now, on the facts, against Hillary Clinton. She was America’s chief diplomat. Look around at the violence and danger in our world today every region of the world has been infected with her flawed judgment.

But let me be specific so you can render your verdict. In North Africa, she was the chief engineer of our disastrous overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya.

Libya today after Hillary Clinton’s grand strategy? Libya’s economy in ruins, death and violence in the streets and ISIS now dominating the country.

Hillary Clinton, as a failure for ruining Libya and creating a nest for terrorist activity by ISIS guilty or not guilty? In Nigeria, Hillary Clinton amazingly fought for two years to keep an Al-Qaeda affiliate off the terrorist watch list.

What happened because of this reckless action by the candidate who is the self proclaimed champion of women around the world? These terrorists abducted hundreds of innocent young girls two years ago.

These schoolgirls are still missing today.

What was the solution from the Obama/Clinton team? A hashtag campaign! Hillary Clinton, as an apologist for an Al-Qaeda affiliate in Nigeria resulting in the capture of innocent young women guilty or not guilty? She fights for the wrong people.

She doesn’t fight for us. She doesn’t get the real threats America faces. In China, Hillary Clinton praised the Chinese government for buying our debt to finance President Obama’s bloated stimulus plan.

So desperate for Chinese cash, she promised to oppose the Buy American provision in the stimulus bill in exchange for the cash to finance his huge expansion of government spending.

Hillary Clinton, putting big government spending financed by the Chinese ahead of jobs for middle class Americans guilty or not guilty? In Syria, she called President Assad a “reformer” and a “different kind of leader”.

With 400,000 now dead…think about that.

Four.

Hundred.

Thousand. Dead.

At the hands of the man Hillary defended.

We must ask this question: Hillary Clinton, as an awful judge of the character of a dictator-butcher in the Middle Eastguilty or not guilty? In Iran, she led the negotiations that brought about the worst nuclear deal in history.

Let me be clear: America and the world are measurably less safe and less respected because of the Iran deal Hillary helped cut.

Period. After she launched those negotiations, she became the biggest cheerleader for it at the end.

A deal that will lead to a nuclear Iran, an Israel that will be less safe and secure and much more dangerous Middle East.

Hillary Clinton, as an inept negotiator of the worst nuclear arms deal in American history guilty or not guilty? In Russia, she went to the Kremlin on her very first visit and gave them the symbolic reset button.

The button should have read, “delete” she is very good at that because she deleted in four years what it took 40 years to build. The next year, she said our goal was to strengthen Russia.

Strengthen an adversary led by a dictator who dreams of reassembling the old Soviet empire? What a dangerous lack of judgment.

Once again, as a flawed evaluator of dictators and failed strategist who has permitted Russia back in as a major player in the Middle East is Hillary Clinton guilty or not guilty? In Cuba, Hillary Clinton supported concessions to the Castro brothers and got almost nothing in return for ending the embargo.

She supported a deal that didn’t even require this murderous regime to return a cop killer, JoAnne Chesimard, to face justice.

Chesimard murdered a New Jersey State Trooper in cold blood, fled to Cuba and lives there to this very day.

How do you live with your own conscience when you reward a domestic terrorist with continued safety and betray the family of fallen police officer waiting for decades for justice for his murder? Hillary Clinton as coddler of the brutal Castro brothers and betrayer of the family of fallen Trooper Werner Foerster guilty or not guilty?

Finally, here at home, in one of her first decisions as Secretary of State, she set up a private e-mail server in her basement in violation of our national security.

Lets face it: Hillary Clinton cared more about protecting her own secrets than she did about protecting America’s secrets.

Then she lied about it over and over again.

She said there was no marked classified information on her server.

The FBI Director said that was untrue.

She said that she did not email any classified information. The FBI Director said that was untrue.

She said all work related emails were sent back to the State Department.

The FBI Director said that was untrue.

As to Hillary Clinton, putting herself ahead of America guilty or not guilty? Hillary Clinton, lying to the American people about her selfish, awful judgment guilty or not guilty? Time after time the facts, and just the facts, lead you to the same verdict both around the world and at home.

In Libya and Nigeria guilty.

In China and Syria guilty.

In Iran and Russia and Cuba guilty.

And here at home on risking America’s secrets to keep her own and lying to cover it all upguilty. Her focus group tested persona, with no genuineness to be found, is a sham meant to obscure all the facts and leave you able to vote for her. We cannot promote someone to Commander-in-Chief who has made the world a more violent and dangerous place with every bad judgment she has made.

We cannot make the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the United Statessomeone who has risked America’s secrets and lied about this to Congress and the American people.

We didn’t disqualify Hillary Clinton to be President of the United States the facts of her life and career disqualifies her. We in this hall agree with all of this.

But I want to talk to all of you at home, in your living rooms. You are the ones who will decide this election. We have an alternative.

We have a man who is unafraid.

We have a man who wants to lead us.

We have a man who understands the frustrations and the aspirations of our fellow citizens.

We have a man who judges people based on their performance regardless of your gender, race, ethnic or religious background. We do not need to settle for less.

We cannot reward incompetence and deceit. We need to demand more than what Hillary Clinton offers for America.

We know exactly what four years of Hillary Clinton will bring: all the failures of the Obama years, but with less charm and more lies. It is our obligation to stop Hillary Clinton now and never let her within 10 miles of the White House again.

It is time to come together and make sure that Donald Trump is our next President.

I am proud to be part of this team.

Now let’s go win this thing.

",2016,republican
Kerry Woolard,"Donald Trump is a man of vision: he isn’t a wide eyed dreamer, but someone who sees what others don’t, and turns that vision into reality, making life better for people and communities across the nation.

I have experienced this firsthand at The Trump Winery and Hotel, which I manage.

When Donald Trump purchased the winery in 2011 it was in receivership. Quickly and decisively he went to work: building the hotel, replanting vines, and making it a world class destination and the largest vineyard in  Virginia.

Today we directly employ more than 100 people and support countless other entrepreneurs, contractors, and suppliers throughout the region.

We generate millions in revenue and millions more in taxes, and have a regional economic impact of nearly $50 million a year which has further strengthened and sustained the community in which our employees and I live

At the winery the returns have been impressive, with nearly 100 percent sales growth in just five years. I’ve not just seen this happen: I’ve helped make it happen, and I can tell you it would not have happened without Donald Trump and his family.

Let me be clear: it was not easy, and it was not inevitable.

It took a team of hard working, dedicated employees: but it takes more than hard work alone.

Our success would not have come to pass without the leadership and the vision of the Trumps.

You often hear Donald Trump talk, but what you don’t see is when he listens. He and his son Eric listen attentively and ask questions that lead to engaged,

informed decisions based on the expert knowledge of those who have earned their trust.

That trust is rewarded not just with compensation but with authority and resources.

The Trumps have also given a gift to those who know them, an approach and an outlook to life by which will always guide me.

Because of them I now think bigger, and in ways I thought might not even be possible.

Donald Trump has told me that a person’s own work ethic and drive are the  only limitations to success.

I now believe that and know it to be true.

This isn’t just a platitude: at Trump Winery it is real, and I’ll tell you it is rare.

It’s been accompanied by respect for my accomplishments, and the opportunity to develop and grow professionally.

That is a direct result of the Trumps’ leadership: leadership that we now need more today, more than ever, in our country.

",2016,republican
Senator Shelley Moore Capito,"Good evening. Let me start out with a question.

Are there any Mountaineers in the audience tonight?

I’m Shelley Moore Capito — the first woman elected to serve the state of West Virginia in the United States Senate.

Ladies and gentlemen — we face challenging times. Times in which we as leaders must ask how we can secure a future — that’s brighter for our next generation.

That’s always the challenge of leadership.

And this election is no different. But with every challenge comes great opportunity.  And that opportunity is what I would like to speak about tonight.

Let me first tell you where I come from — the Mountain State. I’m a life-long West Virginian.

With our tight knit communities — our state is just one big small town.

That’s never been more evident than in this past month as West Virginia was ravaged by flooding — that upended communities — displaced families — and claimed 23 lives.

As I traveled the flood zones — I was inspired by people who — despite losing everything — sought ways to help and serve others. The stories are tragic but uplifting — and I am so proud of my state.

In their jobs and communities — West Virginians work hard and deliver results. And — in turn — they expect our country’s elected leaders to do the  same.

The constant refrain I hear back home — is to stop the bickering — improve  the economy — and fight for jobs.

Let me tell you something — they’re right.

The greatest obstacle for West Virginia families — and families all across America over the past eight years — has been a president that places left-wing priorities and campaign promises over their livelihoods.

President Obama has hurt the heart and soul of my state — our proud coal miners and the communities where they live — work — and pursue  happiness.

His policies have ripped through the heartland — creating a cycle of pessimism and disgust.

People around the country feel the Obama Administration has kicked them to the curb with a callousness that’s damaged their ability to trust and respect government.

In 2008 — President Obama famously said — “If somebody wants to build a coal- powered plant — they can.  It’s just that it will bankrupt  them.”

Eight years later — it’s safe to say that his actions match his words.

He’s never realized that when you bankrupt a coal company — you deprive communities of their livelihood.

His recklessness has cost more than 60,000 coal workers their jobs since 2011. That’s 60,000 families who are now without work — without a paycheck — and without options.

Not to be outdone — Hillary Clinton has already promised — “to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”

She wants to put thousands more Americans out of work.

She has promised to devastate communities and families across coal country.

When I think about Hillary Clinton’s pursuit of an anti-coal agenda — I think about the miner who wakes up before dawn for another ten-hour shift.

I think about the bus driver who drives the miners’ children to school. I think about the nurse who cares for the retired  miners.

I think about the loan officer at the community bank. And I think about the hundreds of coal equipment distributors.

I weep for the fabric of my state.

These men and women take pride in their highly skilled — and good paying jobs that provide for their families and support their  communities.

They work tirelessly to power America.

West Virginia workers are the backbone of this country.

And Hillary Clinton is proudly promising to put them out of work? Now — we shouldn’t be surprised by this.

Because Hillary Clinton understands coal miners and blue-collar workers — about as well as she understands secure email.

A day in the life of a coal miner — and a day in the life of Hillary Clinton — could not be more different.

For over 25 years — she’s thrived in a world where the rules bend to her. Recently we learned she showed “extreme carelessness” with our nation’s secrets.

For others — the consequences of misusing classified information have  been swift and serious.

Not for Hillary Clinton.

Must be nice to have your husband stop in for a friendly chat with the Attorney General on a tarmac during the final days of an FBI  investigation.

Since the end of her husband’s administration — she’s profited from closed-door speeches with fees that could buy homes in West Virginia.

Not only is she out of touch — her attempts to reach out to the American people often reveal how distorted her reality has become.

In another story from the tarmac — detailing the harrowing tale of Hillary’s 1996 trip to Bosnia.

She recalled that they — “landed under sniper fire” — and had to run for cover. But the tape told a very different story.

There were no snipers or hostile forces.

Hillary was greeted by a young girl — who’d written a poem about peace.

What I find most troubling is that Hillary Clinton — fails to recognize that her calculated policies affect real people.

Those who want to feed their families — own homes — pay for college — and pursue the American Dream.

These goals should not and cannot fall out of reach.

You may remember — when President Obama arrogantly proclaimed that he would slow the rise of the oceans — and heal our planet.

He introduced and implemented sweeping environmental regulations without

Congress’ approval — and without considering the economy.

These unilateral actions are ill informed — unconstitutional — and — un- American.

Right now the burden of government regulations in this country amounts to roughly $15,000 a household.

Let me ask you a couple of questions — are you  ready?

Is burdening every household in America with a cost of $15,000 — worth more applause lines at campaign rallies?

Is burdening every household in America with a cost of $15,000 — worth more campaign cash?

Is burdening every household in America with a cost of $15,000 — worth a few more one-liners?

I couldn’t agree with you more.

And I’m sure you agree with me about the importance of this  election.

One of the many reasons this election is so important — is that the Democrats have nominated a candidate that Americans overwhelming  distrust.

She’s earned this reputation.

Her term at the State Department was shrouded in scandal and  mistrust.

A few weeks ago we watched as the FBI Director called Secretary Clinton “negligent.” He questioned her judgment and revealed countless ways she has misled the American people.

Hillary Clinton should be repentant — or at least humbled by this — but she’s not.

We know that the cornerstone of our global leadership is not just our  awesome military — it’s not just our economic power — but our credibility.

She’s squandered Americans’ trust.

Thankfully — the latest misdeed hasn’t slipped past the attention of the American people.

Recent polls showed that voters’ distrust of Hillary was deteriorating her support. So it comes down to trust.

She can’t be trusted with classified information — or trusted to play by the same rules as you and me.

And — without trust — we cannot feel safe and thrive.

No one who has lost the trust of the American people can serve as  President.

The only thing we can trust Hillary to do is double down on the same failed Obama policies that are hurting Americans.

But who knows maybe she’ll feel compelled to pursue the dangerous policies of the socialist wing of her party — which gave her so much trouble this  spring.

We know she will double down on an economic agenda — that’s led to the lowest workforce participation in decades.

We know she will double down on the war on coal. We know that she will double down on Obamacare.

We know that she will double down on far-left Supreme Court nominees — who act like appointed legislators — not as guardians of the  Constitution.

We know that she will double down on the catastrophic foreign policy she herself orchestrated.  Which has emboldened enemies — weakened alliances —  and increased risks to our national security.

The contrast between our vision for the future —- and that of the Hillary Clinton is clear.

Now is the time to turn the tide.

Let’s turn the tide. So that unelected bureaucrats no longer mandate regulations that are disconnected from the realities of working  Americans.

Let’s turn the tide. From an executive who promotes a radical environmental agenda that will raise costs across the country.

Let’s turn the tide. From a Washington that tells us who our doctors should be — and delivers a lower quality of care.

Let’s turn the tide. To a government that respects the Constitution — and protects the jobs and way of life in rural America.

This is not out of reach.  We can make these visions a reality.

This week we’ll officially nominate a candidate —- who received the most primary votes in the history of our party. A candidate who understands how to create jobs and grow the economy.

With Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans leading Congress, Our party wants to allow businesses to create jobs — not regulate jobs out of existence.

Our party understands the free market and doesn’t try to control  it.

Our party protects and stands up for hardworking Americans — like West Virginia coal miners.

Our party will strengthen our military — to face growing  threats.

To ensure our country gets the elected leaders it deserves — we must carry this momentum to elect Donald Trump — who speaks directly to rural Americans who have been devastated by the Obama Administration.     West Virginians know he understands their problems — shares their concerns — and is going to do things differently.

The American people know that Hillary Clinton has forfeited her trust and has broken her bond with working Americans.

Let’s commit to bringing our country together. In the months ahead — the stakes are both clear and high.

Take the energy from this convention back to your state — back to your home — and work to elect Donald Trump, who will make America great again.

Thank you.

Ben Carson,"I devoted my career to studying and operating on the brain. This remarkable organ defines our humanity.

It gives us the ability not only to feel and observe, but also to reason. When deciding who to elect as our next president, we owe it to ourselves and our country to make use of this power of reason to evaluate the character, experience, and intentions of the candidates and make an informed decision.

We must resist the temptation to take the easy way out and passively accept what is fed to us by the media or the political  elite.

One of the most dangerous narratives being advanced by some in our own party is the notion that however dreadful a Hillary Clinton administration may be, the effects will be temporary or harmless….

Consider what she already has done in office. Classified information was recklessly revealed.

Intelligence officers were exposed. An ambassador and three other American patriots were slaughtered. That kind of harm is irreversible. It is absurd to think  we can ask our enemies to disregard those emails or leave our operatives alone. And unfortunately, we cannot resurrect the dead.

Now consider what Hillary will do if elected president.

She will appoint justices to the Supreme Court who share her liberal view of an expansive government that is entitled to trample fundamental  freedoms.

The decisions of a Court dominated by Obama-Clinton appointees will effectively set her cancerous policies in stone.

She will perpetuate a system that traps our children in failing schools and promotes poverty instead of empowerment.

This type of malignant neglect leaves indelible scars on these children and gaping wounds in our communities.

The question before us is not whether we should elect a Republican or a Democrat as president of the United States.

The question we must answer is whether we want to retain the ideals upon which this country was founded or succumb to Hillary Clinton’s new world order that places government in control of every aspect of our  lives.

Donald Trump understands this very well. He understands that the blessings of this nation come with the responsibility to ensure that they are available to all, not just the privileged few.

This is exemplified by his willingness to take on the establishment against all odds.

It is evident in his passion for the American worker.

It is found in his desire to put his considerable skills to work on behalf of American interests, not self-interest.

I am proud to support Donald Trump — the extraordinary businessman and the right leader for our time.

Kimberlin Brown,"Good evening. Many of you may know me from one of your favorite soap operas, The Young & the Restless, the Bold & the Beautiful, and many other television shows and films.

But, since we only have One Life to Live — and yes, I had to throw that in — I decided to follow other dreams.

I’m now an avocado grower for all of you guacamole lovers out there. I also run and operate my own design business.

And, with my husband, Gary – we just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary — Gary and I are partners running a sport fishing business, retail operations, rental operations and assorted other enterprises.

Like millions of women across our nation, I have many responsibilities.

And, because we women have many roles in our lives, I am offended when the media and the Democrats type-cast us a single-issue  voters.

We take care of our families, work inside AND outside the home, pay the bills, manage the costs at home, take care of our parents – all focused on one thing: securing the future of our families.

Like so many parents today, I have great concerns about the direction of our country and what it means for the future of my children.

And, I can’t let this election pass by without doing my part in helping get us back on the right track. That is why I’m so grateful and honored to be here with you tonight.

When I look back at my grandparents and my Mom and Dad, I realize that so much of their lives were devoted to one goal: helping me, my sister Tammy  and brother Chris have every opportunity to succeed. I was always told by my Grandmother I could do anything I put my mind to and I did. I’ve worked very hard.

We have started businesses that have succeeded (and still do) and we have had ventures that have not.  We have created jobs and even more tax dollars.  We have worked 80 hour weeks and have gone without pay checks to keep  employees paid.

This is not unique to Gary and me. It is the story of every small business owner in America.

I am a member of California’s Business Women for Trump. We’re comprised of farmers, doctors, small business owners, attorneys, and women in just about  every field, profession, race and ethnicity.

And, we’re concerned about out-of-control, unreasonable government regulations that needlessly add costs to doing business and tie us ALL up in red tape.

And, don’t get me started about a bewildering tax code and high taxes to boot. This isn’t true just for small businesses but for farming as well.

Just this past week, our business is confronting a problem caused by Obamacare.

What a shock!

As a small business we used to offer medical insurance to our employees and, for those who chose to be covered, we paid most of their  premiums.

This quarter we had several employees work over the 30 hour threshold set by Obamacare and, by the requirements of the law, they must sign up for one of the approved health care plans.

Our younger employees don’t understand why they are getting forced off of their previous plan which was significantly more affordable and tailored to their needs. Most of our employees are college-age and healthy. Yet they are required to buy coverage that does not meet their needs and is too expensive for their  wallets.

One good thing; It has been a wake-up call to our young employees. They all are voting Republican this year!

One third of small businesses are owned by women. To the 9.4 million women business owners who employ about 8 million workers – a value of about $1.5 trillion dollars to our economy — I urge you to think about how important this election is for your future.

Who do you think better understands your challenges and will stand with you fighting for a better economy and more opportunities? —

A career Washington-insider who only knows how to use your tax dollars for more government jobs. And, incidentally, ladies, both in then Senator Clinton’s office and the Clinton Foundation, men have been better paid than women.

Or a successful businessman who knows how to make a payroll, who  understands the special challenges women business owners face, such as gaining access to needed capital, and who has an admirable record of hiring and promoting women in his businesses?

For a moment, I would like to touch on an issue that Donald has spoken about from the beginning of his campaign: trade.

As an actress and a farmer– did you ever expect to see those words in the same sentence – I’ve seen first hand the impact of high taxes, over-regulation, and suspect trade deals.

I have seen tv and movie productions move out of the country.  If you were an

“A” lister like Leonardo DiCaprio or an owner of a studio, you were okay. But, if you were a cameraman, sound tech, boom operator or did any one of the many jobs in a production, you were out of luck.

At the time, it did not affect me and I didn’t understand what my local union boys were talking about. Now I do and I’m sorry for not understanding the plight of these men and women who lost their livelihoods. And they did.

As an avocado grower, I have faced the impact of our trade policies. I’ve seen first-hand our domestic market flooded with imports that harmed local farmers and even drove some out of business. My neighbors who have raised this product for years are being forced to cut down their groves.

I’ll leave decisions about trade policies and how you balance the many economic interests of our nation to others but this much I do know: Donald Trump raised concerns on behalf of working people before the Washington elites did. He will  make trade deals that benefit working men and women and their families right here in America!

There will be a time, and I hope soon, for a woman President. And, why not? As Donald has said, a good woman is worth ten men.

We have so many outstanding women in the Congress and in our state and local governments who are ready for the job now or in the near  future.

But, let’s be clear: the Democrats offer up a woman who when she had a chance to stand up for women, did not do so.

Instead, she attacked women, denigrated them, called them liars. I personally know victims and they find Hilary’s actions and remarks  repulsive!!

Her comments are comments of convenience.

If we are to prosper as a nation, if we are going to grow the economy and create jobs, we need a leader who will go to Washington and shake things  up.

A president who will bring common sense to regulations and eliminate unnecessary ones. Who will fix our tax system.

Who will start us on the path to rebuild our infrastructure.

We need someone who knows how to build things! Who knows how to create jobs!

Who knows how to negotiate!

Who will tackle problems head on, so we can have true progress!

Since it was announced that I was speaking to you tonight, I have been attacked in social media with all kinds of outrageous insults, none of which are even remotely true.

The Left wants to silence those they disagree with. In politics, on college campuses, in business.

This must stop.  I will not stand by idly.

It is time we stood up for ourselves, for Donald Trump and for our country.  Donald is the most qualified man in America to turn things around in Washingtonand our nation.

So I ask you to join me and California’s Business Women for Trump in supporting America’s best opportunity to return to greatness.

Donald Trump, the next President of the United States. Thank you.

Florida Governor Rick Scott,"This evening, Gov. Scott will speak about the recent terrorist attack in Orlandoand the growing worldwide threat of Islamic extremism.  Gov. Scott will emphasize that putting America first will help keep Americans safe. 

My name is Rick Scott, Governor of the great state of Florida.

Before I begin tonight, I want to express my gratitude to everyone who has kept us in their prayers after the horrific and hate-filled terrorist attack in Orlando a month ago. We have received an outpouring of support and love from Americans everywhere. The American people do stick up for each other. On behalf of the state of Florida: thank you, thank you, thank you!

I’m old enough to remember when terrorism was something that happened in foreign countries. Not today. How many more times does the evil of radical Islamic terrorism have to occur, before the President of the United States will muster the courage to face the truth? How many more “Orlandos,” “San Bernadinos,” or “Ft. Hoods” will happen until President Obama decides to be honest? I cried with the grieving moms and dads and brothers and sisters of the 49 people slaughtered by an ISIS-inspired terrorist. This war is real. It is here in America. And the next President must destroy this evil.

Donald Trump is the man for that job.

I met Donald about 20 years ago, before either of us ever ran for office. Let me tell you why this is the time for Donald to be President. A lot of politicians like to give speeches where they say “we are at a crossroads.” But that’s not really where we are. Today, America is in terrible world-record-high debt, our economy is not growing, our jobs are going overseas, we’ve allowed our military to decay, and we project weakness on the international stage. Washington grows while the rest of America struggles. The Democrats have not led us to a crossroads, they have led us to a cliff.

I know that some have reservations about my friend Donald Trump. Perhaps he’s sometimes not polite. He can be a little rough. And he may be too direct. But, this election is not actually about Donald Trump, or Hillary Clinton. In fact, this election is not about you or me either. This election is about the very survival of the American Dream.

It’s time for all Americans to put down the partisan banners, vote for the survival of the greatest country in the world, and do what is right for our country – Vote for Donald Trump!

Finally, I have some great news. This is the time America has been waiting for. This year, we get to fire the politicians! And who better to let the politicians inWashington know “you’re fired” than Donald Trump?

We need a president who is politically incorrect and will tell it like it is. We need a President who isn’t afraid of Washington. We need a President who doesn’t believe government is the answer to every problem. We need a President who recognizes that great countries have borders. We need a President who will bring American jobs back to America. We need a President who is not afraid to say “radical Islamic terrorism.” And we need a President who will wipe ISIS off the face of the earth.

And on every one of these measures Hillary Clinton fails. America is worth fighting for. Let’s make America great again. Let’s elect Donald Trump the next President of the United States.

Laura Ingraham,"Ingraham will discuss the importance of respect for the Constitution, the rule of law, and the inherent rights of the American people the first priority of our elected officials.

You may know me from TV and radio, but my kids know me by my most important name, Mom. I’m a single mother of three adopted children. I’m here tonight supporting Donald Trump because like most Americans, I refuse to leave them a country that is worse off than the one my parents left me.

My grandparents were Polish immigrants. My parents grew up in Depression Era New England. My dad enlisted in the Navy in WWII. My mom waited tables until she was 73.  My dad worked at his car wash. They flew the flag at our house and not just on the 4th of July. They scrimped and saved. My mother made my clothes, and wore the same winter coat for 40 years. Any extra money went into the bank for our education. We learned the dignity found in a job well done. My brothers picked tobacco and delivered newspapers. I picked blueberries and raked lawns. You see, my parents didn’t believe there were jobs Americans wouldn’t do. In the early ’70s, watching the news with my mother, I asked her why people were burning the American flag. She answered: “Because their parents didn’t teach them about respect.”

Respect. We see it in decline once again. The people don’t respect the government.  The government doesn’t respect the people, not even our veterans. Politicians don’t respect the Constitution. Many don’t respect the life of the infant in the womb, or the elderly who languish alone. Others don’t respect the police, who risk their lives every day to protect us. Many in public office don’t enforce or respect the rule of law. Isn’t that right, Mrs. Clinton? Too many citizens and non-citizens don’t respect our laws either. And many of our allies don’t respect us anymore.

It’s sad to see this happen to the country we love. This is our home. It belongs to us, our children and our grandchildren. We deserve better and we can do better. Like us, Donald Trump understands that we must turn this around and restore respect across all levels of society. Unlike us, Hillary Clinton believes the status quo is just fine because she helped create it.

Donald Trump knows that a nation without borders is not a nation at all. Hillary Clinton doesn’t believe in borders. Donald Trump knows that a country must put the interests of its own people first. Hillary Clinton thinks that America is just another nation in a global order. Donald Trump understands that America’s greatness comes from her people, her freedom. Hillary Clinton believes greatness can only be found in an ever-growing government that only Her Majesty rules. She believes that there’s a government solution to every problem. No, Hillary, you’re the problem. And Donald Trump is the solution.

We were in a mess back in 1979, too. Only then it was leisure suits instead of pants suits. Many believed America’s time was up. But then Ronald Reaganarrived just in time to restore our national confidence, our economy and our military.

Donald Trump will do the same. He has pledged to work tirelessly to get our country back on track. We should all, even all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos, pledge to support Donald Trump now. This is the most important election since 1980. We see stagnating wages, skyrocketing healthcare costs, doubling of the debt, the threat of ISIS, the rise of China. And the Democrats’ answer is to nominate someone who helped orchestrate the decline? It has to be a cruel joke.

I don’t want to sit around and tell my kids stories about how great America used to be. Do you? We never give up. We rise to challenges. We fight and win. We’re Americans. We need a president who believes in the Constitution and who will fight for us and with us.

To all my friends in the press, you know in your heart why Donald Trump won the nomination. It’s because he dared to call out the phonies, the frauds, and the corruption that have all gone unexposed, and that you failed to challenge for far too long. Donald Trump respects us enough to tell us the hard truths about what has happened to our country – on issues like immigration, trade, and our diminished status around the world – even in the face of unfair criticism and sheer hatred.

They had their chance. Now, it’s our chance. Let’s reject the politics of division. Let’s defeat the Clinton Machine. Let’s send the consultants and lobbyists packing. Let’s give the power back to the people. And let’s elect Donald Trump President of the United Sates.

Phil Ruffin,"Ruffin will speak about his personal experience working with Donald Trump as a developer, entrepreneur, innovator, and leader.

I’ve known Donald Trump as a friend and a business partner for over 20 years. You can’t be my friend and my business partner for long if you’re not honest with me, and good to your word.  I can tell you Donald Trump is both.

He’s been an innovator and an entrepreneur: no one in our business works harder, or smarter, than he does. Professionally I have seen time and again how he can see what others cannot, and how he has taken properties others took a pass on and made something incredible out of them.

As a result of his vision and hard work he has put tens of thousands of our fellow      Americans to work, created amazing spaces and places, and made money for himself, and his partners. He has done this in many of our nation’s greatest cities such as: Chicago, New York, Miami, and Las Vegas.

Let me tell you about one of the deals we did together. About ten years ago, he and I developed Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. As with so many Trump properties, this has innovative design, and attention to detail. Buyers liked it, and it seemed it would be another tremendous success: it was under budget and on time, however, in 2008 the recession hit, and the banks would not finance any additional units. This left us with about 75 percent unsold, and more than a half billion dollars in debt. Ninety-nine percent of people and investors would have walked away: Donald would not give up.

He is a fighter, and he saw its incredible potential.

I believed in him, and for three tough years we worked together to keep it afloat. Through it all, Donald always paid his bills promptly, with no discounts.

Due to Donald’s persistence and faith, and my faith in him, we turned it around. Today it has become a huge success.

This is just one example.

I have seen him do this time and time again.

He has put money on the line, both his and mine. He is a developer. He is an entrepreneur. He is an innovator. And he is a leader.

He now wants to turn around Washington. When he first told me he was going to run for President, I told him I did not think it was a good idea.

I asked him why he wanted to do this, and he simply replied, “I love America.

Our system is broken, and I am going to fix it.”

This is the Donald I know, and I know what America needs now: a fighter and an innovator.

He sees the potential and he knows what our great country can be if we come together.

Donald Trump will fix what is broken in Washington, and Make America Great Again, and you can bet on that.

Pam Bondi,"Bondi will speak about the importance of restoring the rule of law after eight years of living under an administration that has played fast and loose with our constitutional rights.

November 8th is a day of reckoning for all those who have abused their power.

It is the day that we the people will take back our government.

From Washington bureaucrats playing doctor with our health care.

To a President who’s been playing fast and loose with our constitutional rights and Russian roulette with our borders.

November 8th, is when America feels safe again, when America wins again.

Because winning this election means reclaiming something to which I’ve dedicated my entire career: the rule of law.

Laws that make our neighborhoods safe, and our economy strong. Laws that apply equally to everyone.

Laws that back our law enforcement, now more than ever, because they have our backs.

But today, these laws are under siege by a President determined to ignore laws he doesn’t like, and by a former Secretary of State who believes the laws don’t apply to her.

By the way, she also deserves no security clearance. This lawlessness must stop.

Donald Trump will stop it.

He’ll roll back Obama’s unconstitutional executive orders.

He’ll enforce immigration laws to keep us safe, while allowing legal immigrants to bless this nation with their talents and their dreams. He’ll take control of our borders, because we must stop the flow of cocaine and heroin coming into our country and killing our kids.

Then there’s this. Hillary believes our enemies deserve our respect and empathy.Donald Trump believes terrorists deserve to die.

Hillary will stack the Supreme Court with liberal justices who will allow government to continue its rampage against our individual rights, with utter contempt for our Second Amendment.

I know Donald. He will appoint conservative justices who will defend, rather than rewrite, our Constitution.

Are you ready to send ISIS a message that we’re really coming after them?

When Donald Trump is President, he will.

On November 8th, remember this:

If you believe in limited government…

If you believe in our historic constitutional rights…

If you believe in the rule of law…

If you believe it’s time for America to start acting like America again…

There is only one choice in this election: Donald Trump.

America’s for Trump. And so am I.

Eileen Collins,"Collins will issue a call to once again make America first in space exploration.

From the moment the first Pilgrims arrived on our shores, Americans have been asking, “what’s next?” We are a nation built by the passion of people who weren’t afraid to do something first, to step into the unknown, and pave our own way forward. We are a nation of explorers.

In 1961, President Kennedy issued a challenge to America: to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. 47 years ago on this very day, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin answered that call and walked on the moon. They took with them an American flag and a plaque bearing the inscription: “here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969. We came in peace for all mankind.”

We landed on the moon to fulfill a leadership challenge and to explore. Exploration leads to innovation and discovery. Our successful robotic missions to Mars, Jupiter, and Pluto have provided valuable new information about our own planet.

But in 2011, the space shuttle program ended. The last time the US launched our own astronauts from our own soil was over 5 years ago. We must do better than that!

Countries that are strong explore, invent, and discover to remain resilient in a changing world. I am honored to have played a role in our nation’s heritage of explorers as the first woman to command a space shuttle mission, joining the ranks of those that have fought to lead the way.

We are all so proud of our Apollo program that put our astronauts on the Moon: first, in peace, for all mankind. Nations that lead on the frontier, lead in the world. We need that visionary leadership again. Leadership that will inspire the next generation to have that same passion.

We need leadership that will challenge every American to ask, “What’s next?” We need leadership that will make America’s space program first again. We need leadership that will make America first again. That leader is Donald Trump.

Thank you and God bless the United States of America!

Michelle Van Etten,"Van Etten will speak about making America first by supporting the next generation of American entrepreneurs.

I was born an entrepreneur, by six years old I knew it.

My dream was to be a circus performer so I decided to have a circus at my house. I made tickets, sold them door to door, I even dressed my baby brother as a clown and taught my dog new tricks. I was ready for my big day.

When people started arriving, my parents had no idea about the circus taking place. Embarrassed, they refunded money to my guests and apologized. I was so upset. Afterwards my dad sat me down and told me any dream you have is possible as long as you’re willing to do the work it takes to get the job done. Then he added, “after you go to college.”

But I couldn’t wait. Taking my dad’s advice, I partnered with the neighborhood kids to be part of my circus, and we charged our parents to watch the show. We continued to have our Circus show for over a year. My dad told me I earned great candy money that year!

Fast forward 26 years. Planning for my 20th high school reunion, I decided to check out the girls I went to school with. What I noticed was that my girlfriends looked like Barbies and drove BMWs.  I was 30 pounds overweight, a stay at home mom and drove a minivan.

I decided I needed a change. I began to dream again. I took a leap of faith and started my own network marketing business from home. Like many people who pursue a dream, I had to learn how to fail forward and never quit.

I also had to become the type of person I wanted in my business. Within just two years, my husband was able to retire from 28 years at DOD. Jim Van Etten now homeschools our kids because we choose not to subject them to Common Core.

I opened a fashion studio called MV House of Style in Brandon, Florida. Today I run a thriving multi-faceted business. I am living the American Dream.

But that dream is in jeopardy. My fear is that the next generation – the millennial – who over half of them have an entrepreneurial spirit and want to be their own boss – will not be able to because of the liberal policies that have been implemented over the past eight years.These policies – including higher taxes and excessive regulations – are crushing the American Dream.

Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy.

We need these entrepreneurs.

We live in the land of opportunity.

We need to protect the American Dream above all else.

Are we willing to let government bureaucrats and liberal policies destroy the innovative spirit?If not, then we have to take action.

We need a president who is businessman not a Hillary-crat.

Who understands small businesses are the backbone of America. Who will not raise taxes.Who will repeal Obamacare so small businesses can start offering insurance to their employees again.

Who will end Common Core and protect our children’s education. Who will encourage creativity and innovation. Who will bring manufacturing back to America. Who will make America great and safe again.

There is only one man capable of this juggling act.  Only one man who can take the circus we’ve inherited from the last eight years and serve as the ultimate ringmaster.

There is only one man who can preserve and protect the American Dream for future generations.

That man is Donald Trump. Thank you.

State Senator Ralph Alvarado,"Alvarado will speak about his parents legally immigrating to American and growing up watching them sacrifice every day to provide a better life for their family.  Alvarado will emphasize that by protecting the American dream for the next generation, we can make America first again.

From the great Commonwealth of Kentucky, the home of horses, bourbon, coal, bluegrass, and the finest people on earth, allow me to express my sincerest appreciation and gratitude for the privilege of addressing this assembly.

I am proud to stand before you tonight as the first Hispanic member ever elected to the Kentucky General Assembly. But, the road here was not an easy one. Three failed political runs were lonely at times and full of adversity. But, with a lot of determination, grit, and hard work, I triumphed.

Everything I am and have achieved, I owe to God and my parents. My father was a proud legal immigrant from Costa Rica, my mother from Argentina. Being the son of immigrants, I saw firsthand their sacrifice to provide our family a better life.

I watched their struggle in mastering a second language and their strong and quiet commitment to hard work. We didn’t have the luxuries that other families had, but what my parents did give me was family structure, discipline, support, high personal expectations, love and faith in God. They were Hispanic, they were Americans and they were very proud of being both.

They understood the value of preserving our culture and our language, but also the value of an education and instilling a pride and love for our country.

Like most immigrants, they understood that their sacrifice would not provide them immediate success, but the reward would be in the opportunity and success of their children and grandchildren.

But, this story is not unique to my family; it is the story of many legal Latino immigrants who come to America. At their core, Hispanics believe what Republicans believe: traditional family values, church, faith in God, the dignity of work, and the opportunity for self-sufficiency that comes from a free society and a limited government.

They have simple dreams that might seem mundane to the average American, but would sound familiar to our founding fathers and their core principles.

Some flee corrupt government leaders for the dream of liberty and freedom. Some flee crime and anarchy for the dream of safer communities for their families.

Some flee hunger and despair for the dream of opportunity, entrepreneurship, and abundance.

But, all leave their homelands for the dream of America – the place where if you work hard, study hard, and obey our laws, you can accomplish anything.

Over the past eight years, our President and his apprentice, Hillary Clinton, have talked about that American dream, but they have absolutely no idea how to protect it, foster it, or expand it. Today, we have a President who has not only failed to end racial tension, he has made us more divided than ever.

Today, we have a President who is itching to restrict our fundamental rights, such as religious liberty, the right to bear arms, and free speech.

Today, we have a President who has rejected honesty and transparency, lying to the American people over and over again: from Obamacare to the promise of immigration reform to Fast and Furious to phone record spying to an IRS enemies list to green energy crony bankruptcies to Benghazi – to the VA scandal, to the Iran nuclear deal, the list goes on and on.

And, with Hillary Clinton, this eight year nightmare will get far, far worse.

Americans face an important decision. Do we want someone who is brutally honest (perhaps to a fault) or do we want someone who is brutally dishonest? It is not a decision about America moving left or right, but it is a decision about America going up or down.

By protecting the American dream, we can make America first again.

There is only one candidate who will protect it for our current and future generations.

That candidate is Donald Trump.

And now a message for my Latino friends:

A mis hermanos hispanos: nuestras familias se fugaron le paises llenos de corrupcion y politicos mentirosos.

Por favor, no permitan que esa miseria occura en este pais también.

Vivimos en una isla de libertad y opportunidad.

Voten conmigo.

Voten Republicano.

Y voten for Donald Trump.

Hillary Clinton, you failed the Hispanic community, and you don’t deserve our vote.

Dr. Darrell C. Scott,"Dr. Scott will speak discuss Donald Trump’s unique qualifications for the office of the presidency.

I first met Donald Trump several years ago. He said he was very troubled about the direction our country was heading in. I listened to his vision, and I understood deeply, and shared many concerns he expressed. In the many times we have met since, we have spoken about the economy, race relations, immigration, jobs, urban renovation and revitalization, the military, and other issues that are critical to our nation’s wellbeing.

The truth is Donald Trump is a conservative father and grandfather who feels his best days are in front, not behind him. Despite his accomplishments, he still feels a void, a need to serve his country and his fellow Americans.

The truth is, the Democratic Party has failed us: at home, our growth is lethargic and our debt deeper; we are spiritually empty; and we are more divided now than ever before. Abroad we are neither respected nor feared by our adversaries, and our friends increasingly cannot count on us. This is their legacy.

We need to make a sharp turn. We need to put into practice the great ideals and principles our country was founded on, and which are the source of strength that has made us great.

This is in our interest and the world’s because the greater America is, the greater the entire world becomes. While some call Donald Trump a populist, I call him a patriot. That’s because by definition a patriot is one who loves their country, supports its authority and its interests. Many liberals are embarrassed to use this word.

Many believe we are a nation just like any other: we know we are not a nation like any other, and as Republicans we are unreservedly proud to be Americans and proud of our patriots!

America is a melting pot, a country of diversity: and we stand poised to make history: by standing together as Americans, by standing together as one. We are here as Americans regardless of race, creed, or color.  We are here as those who hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and that we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.

Donald Trump will rebuild the broken trust that now exists between our citizens and our government which over the last eight years has brought the rhetoric of hope, but the reality of higher minority unemployment, crime, drug use, with more civil unrest and national distress.

This election is one of the most crucial elections in American history!

Donald Trump has played for big stakes and is a master negotiator and dealmaker.

He knows that for all the sharp elbows and words that the art of the deal is bringing people together, to unify, to get to yes.

That means problem solving, finding common ground, and moving forward. He has done that for himself for over 30 years: he now wants to take that experience to get the best deal for America and for all Americans.

I believe nothing will prevent Donald Trump from doing everything in his power to create an America that everyone can be proud of.

He believes, as do you and as I do, that we can become great again, and we can become strong again, if we have strong leadership. And I can think of no stronger leader who will place their left hand on a Bible that they believe in, raise their right hand and solemnly swear to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States of America than Donald J. Trump.

God bless Donald Trump, God Bless You, and God Bless America!

Harold Hamm,"Hamm will speak about how unleashing the full potential of America’s vast energy resources will power America to greatness. Hamm will contrast this vast opportunity with Hillary Clinton’s endeavor to crush America’s energy renaissance at the behest of left wing radicals.

Thank you.  It’s good to be in Cleveland.

Four years ago, Donald Trump asked me to tell him about the American Energy Renaissance and how we had transformed the North Dakota Bakken into the largest U.S. oil discovery ever. I told him it was moving America from energy scarcity to abundance, would change the world forever, and could power America to greatness once again. He wrote that down. Donald Trump got it.

President Trump will fuel America’s future and become the first president to achieve American energy independence! President Obama chose not to get it and has tried to destroy this renaissance and all of its benefits. Instead, he turned on Iranian oil, gave them the bomb, billions of dollars, and vilified Israel. Why would he do that?

Obama imposed punitive regulations to stop this renaissance.

In his Administration’s very own words, they want to “crucify” America’s oil and natural gas producers.  Hillary Clinton promises more of the same!

America has two distinct choices.

Our nation should embrace energy independence, not eliminate it.

Hillary Clinton would eliminate fossil fuel development in America, kill jobs, drive up gasoline prices and increase oil imports from our enemies. President Trump will release America’s pent-up energy potential, get rid of foreign oil, trash punitive regulations, create millions of jobs, and develop our most strategic geopolitical weapon… crude oil.

Despite Obama’s attacks, foreign oil imports have plummeted by 65%. America now has more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia or Russia. We can double U.S. oil production again and put America in a global league of its own.

Donald Trump will restore America’s rightful place as the energy leader of the world!

Every time we can’t drill a well in America, terrorism is being funded! Orlandobrought this home once again. It’s been 15 years since 9/11. We can’t ignore this any longer. Climate change isn’t our biggest problem – it’s Islamic terrorism! Every onerous regulation puts American lives at risk. Developing America’s own oil supply is a matter of national security. Critics may say I’m just a well-to-do supporter of Donald Trump. They don’t know about the 13th child of sharecroppers who was inspired by Vo-Ag teacher Jim Hunter.

I couldn’t start school before the first snow or Christmas – whichever came first – because I was pulling cotton to feed our family. My first memories are picking cotton barefoot. I’m standing here tonight because the American dream was alive and well when I struck out on my own at 20 years old with nothing but a truck, a co-signed note and a phone!

Thank God we have a clear choice today.

Donald Trump and Mike Pence will restore the American Dream for the next would-be visionary from small-town America and make America Great Again! God Bless America!

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker,"My fellow Americans, you have a choice. You deserve better. America deserves better. The well-connected in Washington are lining up behind Hillary Clinton, because she is one of them. They want more of the same.

Donald Trump is standing with the American people.

We want a leader who is not afraid to take on the mess in Washington.

We believe that there is a better way forward.

As Republicans, we believe in an America where everyone can get the education and training that they need to succeed in college, career, and life; one whereWashington doesn’t deepen dependency, but rather helps create genuine opportunity.

Why? Because America deserves better.

We believe in a country where people can achieve, maintain, and enjoy their piece of the American Dream – without the government standing in the way.

Why? Because America deserves better.

We believe in a country where we take the threat of terrorism seriously. We name it for what it is: Radical Islamic Terrorism.

And we do everything in our power to eliminate it – to ensure our safety.

Why? Because America deserves better.

We believe in a country where it is a solemn responsibility to deliver to our troops the support and tools they need to achieve victory and then provide them with the health care and respect they’ve earned when they return home.

Why? Because America deserves better.

And while we’re at it, we believe in a country where those who honorably serve in law enforcement – the people who put their lives on the line for us – are not just respected – they are revered.

Why? Because America deserves better.

We believe in a country where power is taken back from Washington and returned home to state and local governments – where it is more effective, more efficient and more accountable to the people.

Why? Because America deserves better.

We believe in a country where freedom and personal success do not come from the clumsy hand of government, but rather the dignity that comes from hard work.

Why? Because America deserves better.

The simple truth is: liberal Washington insiders created these problems. AndHillary Clinton is the ultimate liberal Washington insider. If she were any more on the “inside,” she’d be in prison.

America deserves better than Hillary Clinton.

That is why we need to support Donald Trump and Mike Pence for President and Vice President.

Last August, I said that any of the Republicans running would be better thanHillary Clinton. I meant it then, and I mean it now. So let me be clear: a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump in November is a vote for Hillary Clinton.

Make no mistake: we can’t wait four more years and “get ’em next time.” The consequences are too great. After hearing the FBI Director’s recent comments, I wouldn’t even give Hillary Clinton the password to my iPhone – let alone access to classified information. This isn’t just another Clinton scandal, Hillary’s scandal put our national security at risk and that makes her unfit to be President.

It’s time to tell Hillary: enough is enough. No more double standards for the Clintons.

Why? Because America deserves better.

Thankfully, Republicans are offering a better way forward.

It’s working right here in Ohio and in Florida, New Mexico, North Carolina andSouth Carolina. And even in Massachusetts and Maryland.

Republican leadership works. I see it first hand as it’s working in Wisconsin.

In 2010, we were tired of high unemployment, budget deficits, stifling taxes, and rising college tuition.

Most of all, we were tired of the big government union bosses running our state and local governments. We had enough. So we did something about it. We took back power from the big government special interests and returned it firmly into the hands of the hard-working taxpayers. In turn, the big government special interests – and their cronies in Washington – helped organize more than 100,000 protesters who occupied our state Capitol. They tried to intimidate us with threats and mobs, but we didn’t back down. And we won.

Then, they spent tens of millions of dollars to try and defeat us in a recall election, but we didn’t back down. And we won.

Three times they came at us. Three times we won.

We won because our common sense reforms worked. Today, more people are employed in Wisconsin than ever before, our budget is balanced and responsible, taxes are down for working families and seniors; and college tuition is frozen for four years in a row.

If conservative reforms can work in a blue state like mine, they can work anywhere in the country. You see, it wasn’t too late for Wisconsin and it’s not too late for America.

If you’ve had enough of Washington’s brokenness, wastefulness, empty promises and arrogance, join us. Help us elect Republicans to office – from the courthouse to the statehouse to the White House.

You have a choice. You decide. You deserve better. Because America deserves better.

U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas),"Thank you. Heidi and I are honored to join you here in Cleveland, where Lebron James just led an incredible comeback victory. I’m convinced America is going to come back too.

I congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night.

Conventions are times of excitement. But given the events of the last few weeks, I hope you’ll allow me a moment to talk to you about what’s really at stake.

Just two weeks ago, a nine-year-old girl named Caroline was having a carefreeTexas summer – swimming in the pool, playing with friends, doing all the things a happy child might do.

Like most children, she took for granted the love she received from her mom, Heidi, and her dad, a police sergeant named Michael Smith. That is, until he became one of the five police officers gunned down in Dallas.

The day her father was murdered, Caroline gave him a hug and kiss as he left for work. But as they parted, her dad asked her something he hadn’t asked before:

“What if this is the last time you ever kiss or hug me?'”

Later, as she thought of her fallen father, and that last heartbreaking hug, Caroline broke down in tears. How could anything ever be OK again?

Michael Smith was a former Army ranger who spent three decades with theDallas Police Department. I have no idea who he voted for in the last election, or what he thought about this one. But his life was a testament to devotion. He protected the very protestors who mocked him because he loved his country and his fellow man. His work gave new meaning to that line from literature, “To die of love is to live by it.”

As I thought about what I wanted to say tonight, Michael Smith’s story weighed on my heart. Maybe that’s because his daughter, Caroline, is about the same age as my eldest daughter and happens to share the same name. Maybe it’s because I saw a video of that dear, sweet child choking back sobs as she remembered her daddy’s last question to her. Maybe it’s because we live in a world where so many others have had their lives destroyed by evil, in places like Orlando and Paris andNice and Baton Rouge. Maybe it is because of the simple question itself:

What if this, right now, is our last time? Our last moment to do something for our families and our country?

Did we live up to our values? Did we do all we could?

That’s really what elections should be about. That’s why you and millions like you devoted so much time and sacrifice to this campaign.

We’re fighting, not for one particular candidate or one campaign, but because

each of us wants to be able to tell our kids and grandkids, our own Carolines, that we did our best for their future, and for our country.

America is more than just a land mass between two oceans. America is an idea, a simple yet powerful idea: freedom matters.

For much of human history, government power has been the unavoidable constant in life – government decrees, and the people obey.

Not here. We have no king or queen. No dictator. We the People constrain government.

Our nation is exceptional because it was built on the five most powerful words in the English language: I want to be free.

Never has that message been more needed than today.

We stand here tonight a nation divided. Partisan rancor, anger, even hatred are tearing America apart.

And citizens are furious—rightly furious—at a political establishment that cynically breaks its promises and ignores the will of the people.

We have to do better. We owe our fallen heroes more than that.

Of course, Obama and Clinton will tell you that they also care about our children’s future. And I want to believe them. But there is a profound difference in our two parties’ visions for the future.

Theirs is the party that thinks ISIS is a “JV team,” that responds to the death of Americans at Benghazi by asking, “What difference does it make?” That thinks

it’s possible to make a deal with Iran, which celebrates as holidays “Death toAmerica Day” and “Death to Israel Day.”

My friends, this is madness.

President Obama is a man who does everything backwards – he wants to closeGuantanamo Bay and open up our borders, he exports jobs and imports terrorists.

Enough is enough.

There is a better vision for our future: A return to freedom.

On education, your freedom to choose your child’s education, even if you aren’t as rich as Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.

On healthcare, your freedom to choose your own doctor, without Obamacare.

On taxes, your freedom to provide for your family without the IRS beating down your door.

The Internet? Keep it free from taxes, free from regulation. And don’t give it away to Russia and China.

Freedom means free speech, not politically correct safe spaces.

Freedom means religious freedom, whether you are Christian or Jew, Muslim or atheist. Gay or straight, the Bill of Rights protects the rights of all of us to live according to our conscience.

Freedom means the right to keep and bear arms, and protect your family.

Freedom means Supreme Court Justices who don’t dictate policy, but instead follow the Constitution.

And freedom means recognizing that our Constitution allows states to choose policies that reflect local values. Colorado may decide something different thanTexas. New York different than Iowa. Diversity. That’s the way it’s supposed to be. If not, what’s the point of having states to begin with?

Hillary Clinton believes government should make virtually every choice in your life. Education, healthcare, marriage, speech – all dictated out of Washington.

But something powerful is happening. We’ve seen it in both parties. We’ve seen it in the United Kingdom’s unprecedented Brexit vote to leave the European Union.

Voters are overwhelmingly rejecting big government. That’s a profound victory.

People are fed up with politicians who don’t listen to them, fed up with a corrupt system that benefits the elites, instead of working men and women.

We deserve an immigration system that puts America first. And yes, builds a wall to keep us safe.

That stops admitting ISIS terrorists as refugees.

We deserve trade policies that put the interests of American farmers and manufacturing jobs over the global interests funding the lobbyists.

And if we choose freedom, our future will be brighter.

Freedom will bring back jobs, raise wages.

Freedom will lift people out of dependency, to the dignity of work.

We can do this. 47 years ago today, America put a man on the moon. That’s the power of freedom.

Our party was founded to defeat slavery. Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

We passed the Civil Rights Act, and fought to eliminate Jim Crow laws.

Those were fights for freedom, and so is this.

Sergeant Michael Smith stood up to protect our freedom.

So do our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines fighting radical Islamic terrorism.

So did the family of Alton Sterling, who bravely called to end the violence.

So did the families of those murdered at the Charleston Emanuel AME church, who forgave that hateful, bigoted murderer.

And so can we.

We deserve leaders who stand for principle. Unite us all behind shared values. Cast aside anger for love. That is the standard we should expect, from everybody.

And to those listening, please, don’t stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.

It’s love of freedom that has allowed millions to achieve their dreams. Like my Mom, the first in her family to go to college, and my Dad, who fled prison and torture in Cuba, coming to Texas with just $100 sewn into his underwear.

And it is love that I hope will bring comfort to a grieving 9-year-old girl in Dallas – and, God willing, propel her to move forward, and dream, and soar . . . and make her daddy proud.

We must make the most of our moment – to fight for freedom, to protect our God-given rights, even of those with whom we don’t agree, so that when we are old and gray . . . and our work is done . . . and we give those we love one final kiss goodbye . . . we will be able to say, “Freedom matters, and I was part of something beautiful.”

Thank you. And may God bless the United States of America.

Newt Gingrich,"Thank you for that very generous welcome. And thank you, Callista.  You know, she makes documentary films, and writes a best-selling children’s series on American history. In addition, she sings in the Basilica Choir, and plays the French horn in the Fairfax Band.  I am amazed at her achievements.

Tonight I want to speak about a subject that has dominated my thinking for decades: How do we keep America safe?

Keeping America safe is the first responsibility of the American president. There have been many fascinating things to watch about the extraordinary,historic rise of Donald Trump.

But the most significant has been Donald Trump’s courage to tell some important truths about our national security.

For example:

—   We are at War.

—   We are at War with Radical Islamists.

—   They are determined to kill us.

—  They are stronger than we admit

— And are greater in number than we admit.

—  And there is NO substitute for victory.

In contrast to Donald Trump, our national security and foreign policy elites, led by Hillary Clinton, are incapable of speaking with such honesty.

While THEY lie about the threat, WE need to tell the truth about the  danger.

If our enemies had their way, not a single woman in this room could define her future.

If our enemies had their way, not a single Jew or Christian in this room would be alive unless they agreed to submit.

If our enemies had their way, gays, lesbians and transgender citizens would be put to death as they are today in the Islamic State and Iran.

If our enemies had their way, every person on earth would be subject to conversion by the sword and to a cruel and violent system of  laws.

There would be no individual liberty. There would be no equality.

There would be no freedom. If you doubt we are at war…

If you doubt that this threat is as real as I say… Let me refresh your memory:

On Monday, an Afghan refugee in Germany used an axe and knives to slash  and wound train passengers while shouting “Allahu Akbar.”

Last week, ISIS claimed responsibility after a Tunisian man drove a cargo truck into crowd in Nice, France. He murdered 84 people, including at least 10 children and three Americans, and injured over 300 others.

Two weeks ago, more than 300 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded in bombing attacks in Baghdad.

Two days before that, radical Islamists in Bangladesh killed 20 hostages, including 3 American college students.

A few days before that, at the Istanbul airport in Turkey, ISIS attackers armed with guns and bombs killed 44 people and injured a few hundred more.

Last month, a radical Islamist in Paris stalked a French police officer to his home, where he murdered the officer and tortured his wife to death in front of their three-year-old son, while streaming it all on social media.

He was pondering whether to kill the three-year-old when he was killed by police.

Two days before that, an attacker pledging allegiance to ISIS killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub and wounded dozens more.

All this in JUST the past 37 days.

We risk growing numb to these accumulating atrocities.

One recent analysis estimated that since January of 2015, some 30,000 people have been killed at the hands of terrorists.
Donald Trump is right.

We are at war with radical Islamists, we are losing the war, and we must change course to win the war.

Let me be very clear, because I know the news media will do their best to distort this.

We have nothing to fear from the vast majority of Muslims in the United States, or around the world.

The vast majority are peaceful. They are often the victims of the violence themselves.

They are people we would be happy to have as our friends and neighbors.

The challenge is, when even a small percentage of a billion, six hundred million people support violence against those who disagree with them, that is still a giant recruiting base.

For example, Pew Research finds that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistansupport ISIS.

Unfortunately, that 9 percent is 16 million people. And that’s just one country.

So the truth is, although we are losing the war with radical Islamists, we have been very lucky.

The danger we face is much worse than the horrors that happened in Germanyon New Year’s Eve, when 2,000 women were assaulted.

It’s worse than what’s happening in France, where there are stabbings of Jews in the streets and the intelligence chief warned recently that Europe is QUOTE “on the brink of civil war.”

It’s worse than what’s happening in Israel, where average citizens fear for their lives whenever they leave their homes.

The danger is even worse than September 11th, when 19 hijackers murdered almost 3,000 Americans.

No. The worst case scenario is losing an American city to terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction.

Instead of losing 3,000 people in one morning, we could lose more than 300,000.

Instead of losing 2 great buildings, we could lose block after block after  block to a nuclear event.

That’s not just my view. Back in January of 2001, the Hart Rudman Commission warned that terrorists QUOTE, “will acquire weapons of mass destruction…and some will use them.

Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers.” 15 years later, the dangers are even greater.

In a world where Pakistan has nuclear weapons… where North Korea has nuclear weapons…

and where IRAN–the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism–is close to having nuclear weapons…this, a catastrophic attack on innocent Americans, is a very real threat.

Which brings us to the heart of the matter.

We are sleepwalking through history as though this is all about politics. It is not.
It is about our safety and our survival as a country.

And this is why every American should be terrified at the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency.

If Hillary is elected, she will keep in place the people and the systems that lie to us every single day about this threat.

We know she will do this because as Secretary of State, she has been right at the center of this dishonesty.

We know this administration and its allies lied to us about the Iran nuclear deal.

We know it because they openly bragged about it to the New York Times.

We know that Hillary Clinton lied to us knowingly about the terror attack on  our

Benghazi consulate on September 11, 2012.

We know that Hillary Clinton and President Obama lie to the American people when they say they can safely screen the Syrian refugees.  They cannot.  And yet Hillary wants to increase the number by 500 percent.

So when you hear about Hillary’s dishonesty, or the emails, or taking millions from the Saudis and other Middle Eastern dictatorships–remember: this is NOT about politics.

The cost of Hillary’s dishonesty could be the loss of America as we know it. The first step forward to safety is electing a leader who will be truthful with  the American people about the realities we face. Only then will we understand, support, and demand the strategies required to confront this threat.

And because safety and security are the preconditions for our freedom and prosperity, it is also the first step toward rebuilding the America we  love.
Donald Trump understands this.

And that’s why he WILL rebuild our military–because he knows that a strong military is the best way to ensure peace.

Donald Trump WILL secure our borders–because there is no such thing as a nation without a border.

Donald Trump WILL enforce our immigration laws. He will end the policy of deliberate non-enforcement and will end the abuse of our visa programs–to protect American workers, and their wages.

Donald Trump WILL take care of our veterans by holding bureaucrats at  the Veterans Administration accountable.

He WILL fire those responsible for the waiting lists, and WILL give veterans more choices about their care.

With Donald Trump’s leadership, no bureaucrat will get between a veterans and their doctor.

Donald Trump WILL get America building again.

He will blow apart the ridiculous regulations and requirements that drive up infrastructure costs and drag out the timeline to get anything  built.

The Trump Infrastructure program WILL make us once again the most competitive economy in the world.

Donald Trump WILL rebuild our education system, and give EVERY PARENT   of EVERY income and EVERY ethnic background a choice about where their children go to school.

And Donald Trump will help us rebuild our communities one life and one family at a time. Here again, the first step is safety– the  basis for strong families, and good jobs, and vibrant neighborhoods.

That means restoring law and order.

Donald Trump will show ZERO tolerance for people calling for the death of police officers.

Think about this. If anyone publicly threatens the life of the President of the United States, the Secret Service is on them in an instant.

Our law enforcement officers deserve the same respect.

And OF COURSE, if individual officers are found to have violated someone’s rights, they must be held accountable under the law.

America is BASED on the rule of law.

We are one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for ALL.

That is what has allowed us to absorb more people from more backgrounds than any nation in history.

Nobody is above the law.

And nobody is too small to deserve its protection.

Donald Trump won our party’s nomination because he is willing to tell the truth about the things that matter most.

He has a GREAT running mate in Mike Pence.

They will put our safety first, and they will defend America first. We can be proud to stand with them.

So tonight, the challenge for everyone in this hall, and everyone–Republican, Democrat, or Independent–who is watching at home and knows we cannot continue on our current course…

…Is to rise above our factions, and rise above the politics we’ve inherited; to ignore the lies of the news media and the old order; to reject the suicidal DISHONESTY of Hillary Clinton and her establishment allies;  and to be proud to stand with Donald Trump and Mike Pence for  what we know is true:

We CAN make America safe again; We CAN make America work again; We CAN make America first again;

And together, we CAN make America great again — for ALL Americans. Thank you and God Bless the United States of America.

Brock Mealer,"Mealer sustained his injury in a car crash involving several members of his family just five minutes away from their home. His brother Elliot, an offensive lineman headed to the University of Michigan to play football, was able to free Brock from the wreckage, but the two brothers lost their father, David, and Elliot’s girlfriend,Hollis Richer, in the crash. Today, Brock has conquered the odds and is able to walk again.

Christmas Eve 2007, my parents, my younger brother, Elliott, his girlfriend, Hollis Richer, and I were driving to church. Out of nowhere, a car ran a stop sign, crashing into us. My father, my hero, David Paul Mealer, and Hollis died that night.

I endured eight and a half hours of surgery.

When I awoke, the surgeon came into my hospital room with more devastating news.

My spinal cord damage was about the worst she had ever seen. She said that I would likely never walk again—that even a one percent chance was overly optimistic.

But that 1% was all I needed. Through it all, I had faith in Jesus Christ, believed in myself and strived to make that one percent a reality.

Truthfully, God made that 1% a reality; His will, not mine. He blessed me with football coaches Rich and Mike, who gave me a fighting chance. His blessings enabled me to graduate from The Ohio State University and go on to be cheered by University of Michigan fans, as I led the Wolverines onto the field. He blessed me with my beautiful wife, Haley; we walked down the aisle together. He gave me countless other blessings. This very moment, for me, is a testament to God working all things for the good.

And guess who else was told he had a 1% chance? A company that analyzes polling data for CNN predicted last year that Donald Trump had a 1% chance of winning the Republican nomination for president. Mr. Trump, welcome to the club!

I defied the odds. But I couldn’t do it on my own.

Donald Trump can’t do it alone either. He needs our help and support. Just asMichigan was willing to adopt a Buckeye, for a cause greater than ourselves, we can unite behind Donald Trump to Make America One Again.

Now I want to turn it over to a fellow Ohio State graduate who really knows how to unite a team—Coach Bobby Knight.

U.S. Representative Marsha Blackburn (TN-7),"Good evening to all and to those watching at home, on iPhones, and Twitter. I have a question. Do you want to help make America one again?

We’ve had enough of bloated budgets, un-kept promises, pointless redlines.

Enough division and heated rhetoric whose only purpose is to drive a wedge between us and our neighbor. Enough seeing our 401ks get smaller, our bills get bigger, our taxes go up and our paychecks shrink. We’ve had enough!

You’re ready for a change – for someone to take the reins, bring us together.

A man who can get the job done. Or as Larry the Cable guy would say, ‘Git ‘er done! Someone who comes in ahead of schedule and under budget.

Who’s read the specs, seen the bottom line, negotiated the cost, built something to last. A leader who knows the country is not full of assets to be managed, forgotten, deleted. Our nation’s citizens want a leader who knows the sure route to prosperity, who inspires, who knows leading is a hard-fought verb and not a subject line in an email.

That’s why I’m asking you to join me in electing Donald Trump president.

Donald Trump has the skills required to lead such a diverse nation, and can help people achieve greatness. He believes in the American dream because he has lived the American dream. Why?

Greatness isn’t new. President Lincoln stood in this very city 155 years ago with a call to bind together or perish apart: “If all do not join now to save the good ship of the Union this voyage, nobody will have a chance to pilot her on another.”

And again we find our nation in desperate need of true leadership. We are in desperate need of unity.

The last eight years have been a challenge, to our national and household budgets, our Constitution, to the men and women who give their lives and sacred honor to protect both.

Donald Trump is a leader who has seen challenges, learned lessons, solved problems, delivered results.

Some of our greatest leaders have been people who worked in the real world, know firsthand how cumbersome rules and unnecessary regulations get in the way of greatness.

I want a president who knows leadership is not as it appears, but as it performs. Who has seen something through from beginning to completion. Who looks at the mundane, sees magnificence. After all, that’s the magic of this country – everyday people, with big ideas and the drive to complete them, can change the world.

Leadership is not about lines on a resume.

Gender, race, zip code, pedigree, lineage and hurt feelings aren’t qualifiers. Leadership is a record of performance, accomplishment, team building.

That’s leadership you can trust.

Americans are bound together by the shared desire for freedom, faith, family, hope, and opportunity. We want a president who believes that you, notWashington, know what’s best. Believes you have the right to pursue your version of the American dream.

America is on the edge of great, mighty things. We need a President Donald Trump who is about freedom. Who will choose to unite, not divide.

Together we’ll get the country building, working, see jobs come back, communities grow, leaders lead.

Together we’ll be great again.

Together we’ll be one again.

Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin,"Fallin has served as the chairman of the National Governors Association, where she led a nationwide initiative to help better align education with the needs of a modern-day workforce.

Thank you.

I grew up in Tecumseh, a small town in Oklahoma. It was one of those all-American towns where everyone watches high school football on Friday nights, and neighbors take care of neighbors. In Tecumseh, we understood poverty. But it wasn’t a destiny that was inevitable. We were optimistic about the future, and knew we could succeed with hard work, a good education and faith in God.

There weren’t many opportunities for young women, but we did have a great role model: the mayor, my mom. She taught me if I worked hard, I could be anything. I took that lesson to heart, and eventually became the first female governor ofOklahoma.

Even at a time when the shadow of institutional discrimination fell over much of our country, there was no shortage of African-American heroes. Black Oklahomans like Clara Luper were leading sit-ins and successfully integrating schools across the state, winning the fight for respect and opportunity. So, when I look back on my childhood, my America, I don’t see a perfect place. But we were united by a simple belief: that no matter who you were or where you came from, better days were just ahead for America.

Today, I’m afraid we’re losing that sense of unity and optimism, not just in towns like Tecumseh, but across this land. Our country is divided, our people are afraid, and our spirits are nearly broken. But we can’t allow hopelessness to become the new normal. And we won’t.

The American people are longing for the American dream where they can get a fair shake at life and the opportunity to succeed. We must make America One Again and restore confidence in the strength of our nation.

It is no secret Donald Trump is a bold, tenacious, courageous and outspoken leader. He knows how to create jobs and successful businesses. He has bold ideas and speaks truth to power. He is a man who will get this country on the right track, who believes in peace through strength and will protect America against radical Islamic terrorists who seek our destruction. Our nation has united time and time again on our core values of freedom, individual liberty and justice for all – the principles on which our country was founded, and the principles that Donald Trump unapologetically stands for.

We are one in our belief that America must address the national debt – not by increasing taxes – but by increasing opportunity. We are one in our belief that we must protect our borders, and promote fair trade that puts American workers first. We are one in our belief that we must stand with allies like Israel, a beacon of freedom and democracy in the Middle East. We are one in our belief that we must respect and honor our military, veterans, and law enforcement, whose sacrifice keeps us safe and free. And we are one in our belief in that every life is precious, regardless of race or class, including the lives of unborn children.

As a party, we don’t agree 100 percent on everything. That’s OK. We don’t have to. As Ronald Reagan said, “the person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and ally.” We invite every American who believes in these principles, who longs for an end to division and wants to make America one again, to join us in electing Donald Trump president of the United States.

May God bless you all, and may God bless America!

Dr. Lisa Shin,"My name is Lisa Shin. I am deeply humbled and honored to speak to you as a national delegate from the great state of New Mexico!

I am a Christian, a wife, and a mother. I have been in private practice as an optometrist for the past 19 years. I am Korean-American. And I am very proud to be a supporter of the next President of the United States, Donald J. Trump!

Over 40 years ago, my parents left South Korea to come to America. They knew that America was an exceptional and generous country where immigrants could become American citizens, participate in American democracy, and live the American dream. They knew America was the land of opportunity and freedom, where immigrants could succeed and prosper. So they swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. My parents endured countless hardships and made tremendous sacrifices to pursue the Dream. And they never imagined that one day, their daughter would be speaking to you today. This is the beauty of the American Dream: to do and to be, the unimaginable.

Hillary Clinton is a direct threat to the American Dream.

Her proposals would be utterly devastating to our economy. Her dangerous ideology undermines our democracy and freedom. She represents everything that is wrong with the system: the deceit, corruption, cronyism, and a total lack of accountability. With extreme carelessness, she has compromised our national security and our safety. With contempt, she has flouted the rule of law that we rely on for justice, order, and peace. She has overwhelmingly lost the trust of the American people. She is not qualified to be our next president. She is unfit to be the commander in chief of the brave men and women who sacrifice so much to fight for our country.

There is only one presidential candidate who will preserve the American dream that our parents and our grandparents envisioned for us. There is only one candidate who will ensure a more prosperous, safe, and secure future for our children and our grandchildren. There is only one candidate who will defend the core principles that this great country was founded upon. There is only one candidate who will protect, stand with and fight for we, the American people. There is only clear choice for America: that choice is Donald J. Trump.

Reince Priebus,"Thank you.

To the people of Cleveland, we say thank you for your hospitality. I stand before this convention tonight as the Chairman of a party that is carrying the torch of liberty.

We are the party of the open door.

To some people and some presidents America is just another country. To Republicans, America is the greatest nation on earth.

We don’t apologize for America. We celebrate America.

At every level, Republicans stand for aspiration and achievement. We stand for peace and prosperity. We stand for freedom and fairness.

These values have inspired people the world-over, ever since we won our freedom over two centuries ago. These values fueled the sacrifices for freedom at Gettysburg and Normandy and Fallujah. These values spurred the fight for equality in Birmingham and Selma.

It is clear the Republican Party is the only party willing to fight for these values and lead America to greatness in the 21st century.

See, the dirty little secret Democrats don’t want you to know is that they are the party of the same old thing. Next week they are going to trot out the same old Democrats with the same old message running the same old candidate.

We are the party of new ideas in a world changing faster than ever.

Democrats depend on super delegates and bureaucrats to sneak their agenda through the backdoor.

We are the party of the grassroots. We honor what the voters say.

Democrats want to put labor union bosses in charge of our schools, limit our choices, and feed our kids a steady diet of left-wing propaganda.

We know every child matters and the classroom is not an assembly line. It’s time to give power back to parents, embrace school choice, and equip our children with the skills they need for college, career and life.

Democrats want healthcare choices in the hands of politicians. We want healthcare choices in the hands of patients. Democrats want Washington to impose a one-size-fits-all policy on everybody.

We say an independent people deserves individual solutions.

What separates Republicans from Democrats is our belief in better. We believe in better schools. A better healthcare system. A better economy which rewards hard work no matter where or when you punch the clock.

And most of all, we believe in a better chance at the American dream for everyone. The Republican Party will not stop until it becomes a reality. And that’s why we need to stop Hillary Clinton.

A Clinton presidency only means more debt, more Obamacare, and more hard-working families never seeing a raise.

If given the chance, Hillary Clinton will stack the Supreme Court with activist left-wing judges who will treat the Constitution like a doormat.

You can kiss your gun rights goodbye if she ever finds her way into the White House. In foreign policy, a Clinton presidency means forgetting our friends and enabling our enemies.

Just look at her disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which lined the pockets of the world’s number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money, while abandoning our greatest ally in the Middle East, the nation of Israel.

It was on her watch ISIS began to spread its wings of evil over the Middle East. And she has spent the last 16 months looking into the eyes of the American people and lying about how she recklessly jeopardized national security with her secret email server.

She lied. And she lied over and over and over.

Perhaps worst of all, Hillary Clinton has perfected the art of politics for personal gain. She reads ethics rules as carefully as Americans read their junk mail. Just look at her track record.

She used her post as Secretary of State to grease the wheels for Democrat lobbyists, special interests, and political insiders connected to the corrupt Clinton Machine.

Her family foundation took millions of dollars in donations from countries

notorious for human rights abuses and funneling money to radical Islamic terrorists.

For Hillary Clinton, the Oval Office is just another cash cow. Well, I have one word for all this hypocrisy and corruption.

Enough.

Americans have had enough of a government that plays favorites with the well-connected. They’ve had enough of the Clintons’ excuses, cronyism and cover ups. They’ve had enough of the corrupt dealings. Americans have had enough.

This election is our chance to stop it and Donald Trump is the right man to lead that charge. He’s brought millions of new voters into our party because he’s listening to Americans who are anxious about a country which has lost its way.

Donald Trump wants to bring jobs back from overseas and hold companies who want to send them abroad accountable. He’s finally going to stop illegal immigration and make sure our government puts American citizens first.

Working families are the lifeblood of our country, and we can’t thrive as a nation unless they are thriving. A lot of them haven’t seen a bigger paycheck in a long time.

Donald Trump wants to make sure you can pay the mortgage, put gas in the car, and buy new clothes for the first day of school.

Donald Trump is committed to hitting terrorists hard and making the safety of every man, woman, and child in America his number one priority.

No more negotiating with terrorists. If they want to take us down, we will take them down.

He will protect the Second Amendment, and every other right guaranteed in the Constitution, by appointing conservative justices to the Supreme Court.

And he’s going to protect the lives of the unborn. So I have a message to America: hold on.

Help is coming.

With Donald Trump and Mike Pence, America is ready for a comeback after almost a decade of Clinton-Obama failures.

I want to close by telling you a little-known story of American greatness.

William Nudesen was a Danish immigrant who started out working in a shipyard and living in a boardinghouse. He knew America promised limitless opportunity, and was determined to make the most of it.  He developed his talents for industrial engineering and worked his way up at General Motors. By 1937, he had become the President of the company.

In 1940, the government asked him to get America’s factories on a wartime footing.

Instead of cars and trucks, America’s great manufacturers were now proudly making tanks and planes.  For this enormous responsibility, Nudesen was paid $1per year.

He didn’t do the job for the money. He was motivated by a duty to keep America free from tyranny. He set aside the job of leading one of the largest companies in America so he could help save the world.

At the end of the war, a war department official told him, “You have never done anything for yourself, only for your country. You have never spared yourself.”

Like William Nudesen, we cannot spare ourselves either. Economic freedom. Belief in the American Dream. A strong national defense. Putting country first.

Those values are under assault from Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Democrat party. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is not just a tagline for a bumper sticker.

It is our American legacy, and it is our responsibility to save it and strengthen it for our children and grandchildren.

God put us here not by accident. This is our moment to set a new course for an America as strong and confident as we’ve ever been.

Let’s stand united as Republicans. Let’s stop Hillary Clinton. Let’s get to work, expand our Republican majorities, and elect Donald Trump president.

Thank you and God bless America.

In 1984, my father stood at this convention and offered the opening prayer before our party’s candidate, Ronald Reagan, went on to accept the nomination and win in a landslide.

A little over 30 years later, I stand here with the sincerest prayer that history is about to repeat itself with the election of Donald J Trump. Most of our nation’s founders had strong faith, as I do, in our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

My family has lived in Virginia since the 1600s and in the Lynchburg, Virginia area since 1834.

My wife, Becki, is a descendant of George Washington’s family.  Every day, I drive past Poplar Forest, the summer home of Thomas Jefferson who wrote in the Declaration of Independence.

We are all endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights and among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Our founding fathers envisioned a government that existed only to protect these God given rights and a nation governed by citizen legislators.

The most effective politicians were never career politicians, but surveyors, architects, ministers, farmers, businessmen and even actors who were successful in the private sector before serving in government.

Donald Trump follows in this rich tradition. He has created jobs for thousands and is one of the greatest visionaries of our time.

I first supported Mr. Trump after I spent 20 years as a young lawyer working with my father to restore Liberty University to financial health.

Since 2007 Liberty has become the largest and most prosperous Christian university in the world and I am convinced that Donald Trump can work the same magic for a nation $19 trillion in debt.

But my family and I have grown to love and respect the Trumps for other reasons. We have never met such a genuine and loving family.  I truly believe Mr. Trump is America’s blue collar billionaire. He is down to earth, he loves America and the American people. He is a true patriot and a champion of the common man.

Mr. Trump has added a plank to this party’s platform to repeal IRS rules sponsored by Lyndon Johnson in 1954 barring churches and non-profits from expressing political free speech. Conservative universities and churches have been investigated while authorities have too often turned a blind-eye toward liberal groups, including universities where left-wing ideology is so pervasive that they have in effect become Democratic-voter indoctrination camps. Trust me, this will create a huge revolution for conservative Christians.

We are at a crossroads where our first priority must be saving our nation. We must unite behind Donald Trump and Mike Pence.

A decision not to vote or to vote for a third-party candidate is a de facto vote forHillary Clinton. If Hillary Clinton is allowed to appoint the next few Supreme Court justices, that in itself could be a fatal blow to our republic.

On the other hand, a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to uphold the 2nd amendment right to bear arms. A vote for Trump is a vote to stop Iran, a nation committed to the destruction of the state of Israel, from becoming a nuclear power. A vote for Trump is a vote to appoint conservative pro-life justices to the Supreme Court.

In the days before my father passed away in 2007, he joked with CNN that he dreamed Chelsea Clinton had asked him in an interview about the three greatest threats facing the nation. He replied, Osama, Obama and yo’ Momma. Osama is now gone, Obama has six months left on his term and the only way to make America great (and one) again is to keep Chelsea’s Momma from ever becoming president of the US by electing Donald Trump and Mike Pence as the next president and vice-president of the United States.

Peter Thiel,"Good evening. I’m Peter Thiel.

I build companies and I support people who are building new things, from social networks to rocket ships.

I’m not a politician.

But neither is Donald Trump.

He is a builder, and it’s time to rebuild America.

Where I work in Silicon Valley, it’s hard to see where America has gone wrong.

My industry has made a lot of progress in computers and in software, and, of course, it’s made a lot of money.

But Silicon Valley is a small place.

Drive out to Sacramento, or even just across the bridge to Oakland, and you won’t see the same prosperity. That’s just how small it is.

Across the country, wages are flat.

Americans get paid less today than ten years ago. But healthcare and college tuition cost more every year. Meanwhile Wall Street bankers inflate bubbles in everything from government bonds to Hillary Clinton’s speaking fees.

Our economy is broken. If you’re watching me right now, you understand this better than any politician in Washington. And you know this isn’t the dream we looked forward to. Back when my parents came to America looking for that dream, they found it—right here in Cleveland.

They brought me here as a one-year-old, and this is where I became an American.

Opportunity was everywhere.

My Dad studied engineering at Case Western Reserve University, just down the road from where we are now. Because in 1968, the world’s high tech capital wasn’t just one city: all of America was high tech.

It’s hard to remember this, but our government was once high tech, too. When I moved to Cleveland, defense research was laying the foundations for the Internet. The Apollo program was just about to put a man on the moon—and it was Neil Armstrong, from right here in Ohio.

The future felt limitless.

But today our government is broken. Our nuclear bases still use floppy disks. Our newest fighter jets can’t even fly in the rain. And it would be kind to say the government’s software works poorly, because much of the time it doesn’t even work at all.

That is a staggering decline for the country that completed the Manhattan Project. We don’t accept such incompetence in Silicon Valley, and we must not accept it from our government.

Instead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East. We don’t need to seeHillary Clinton’s deleted emails: her incompetence is in plain sight. She pushed for a war in Libya, and today it’s a training ground for ISIS. On this most important issue, Donald Trump is right. It’s time to end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country.

When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union. And we won. Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom.

This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?

Of course, every American has a unique identity.

I am proud to be gay.

I am proud to be a Republican.

But most of all I am proud to be an American.

I don’t pretend to agree with every plank in our party’s platform. But fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline.

And nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump.

While it is fitting to talk about who we are, today it’s even more important to remember where we came from. For me that is Cleveland, and the bright future it promised.

When Donald Trump asks us to Make America Great Again, he’s not suggesting a return to the past. He’s running to lead us back to that bright future.

Tonight I urge all of my fellow Americans to stand up and vote for Donald Trump.

Pastor Mark Burns,"Hello Republicans, are you Ready to elect the next President of these United States of America? I’m Pastor Mark Burns from the Great State of South Carolina!

It is so important Republicans, that we come together to defeat Hillary Clintonand those liberal race-baiting, Democrats who will do whatever it takes to keep us Americans focusing on the colors that divide us and not the colors that unite us. Because only together we will never allow Hillary Clinton to become the next President of the United States of America.

And I want to declare to the whole world and to the Republican Party that under a Donald Trump Administration, all lives matter. That means black lives, white lives, Hispanic lives, Asian lives, Christian lives, Muslim lives, shout with me, all lives matter.

Even though I disagree with the tactics and divisive rhetoric of the Black Lives Matter movement, I do understand that hopelessness and lack of opportunity breeds desperation.

This is true in many of our nation’s ghettos and underprivileged communities. Much of protests in urban centers are born out of this kind of desperation. Good jobs, urban economic revitalization, and an opportunity for job training are long-term solutions that can turn our troubled cities around.

We as Republicans are declaring to the world that we are more determined than ever to listen to the cries of the disenfranchised, of the low-income and at-risk communities. And I know, without a shadow of doubt, that Donald J. Trump will make sure that all Americans will have   jobs!

And if we together, not as black Americans, white Americans, brown Americans, yellow Americans, or red Americans, but just as Americans, that we as a people will get to the promise land where jobs have returned to this country, college degrees replace mass incarcerations, and no matter what terrorist group that tries to destroy our way of life, we will always rise from the ashes, we will never die, why, because we are the United States of America! And despite the color you was born with, here in America, the only colors that matter is the colors of red, white and blue! USA. USA. USA.

I’m Pastor Mark Burns, and I invite you to help me elect the next President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump!

Tom Barrack,"Tonight, I am honored to stand before you as the son of a humble Lebanese grocer,

the grandson of immigrants, and a proud American blessed to live in the freest nation on Earth.

For over three decades, I have seen Donald up close and personal, as a great pal and business partner, across the spectrum of life’s twists and turns. My purpose here in front of you today is to share a different side of Donald Trump – a side that is not always made visible by the press but one that becomes as clear as day when you move a little closer, beyond the glaring lights, and television cameras.

The words that I use to describe Donald are words that people do not hear often: compassionate, kind, loyal, dedicated, trustworthy, courageous, empathetic and fatherly.

Children are the true litmus test for all of us as parents. Many of you have gotten to know Donald’s children during this Convention, and, as you have seen, they are far from children of entitlement and privilege but rather share a legacy of grace, dedication, intense discipline and a rare touch, like their father, to connect with people.

I could share many stories about Donald’s tremendous business acumen and instincts – his incredible ability to build consensus among warring factions and bring adversaries together behind a workable solution.

I have nothing negative to say about Hillary because I do not need to. Instead, I will share why Donald is the best and the most capable athlete on the field, in what has become a simple race between entrenched status quo and enlightened disruption. I know that Donald is that athlete because I have watched him through the mountains and the valleys by sticking to simple, practical tenets like:

Don’t confuse efforts with results. Do what you say. Do it now.

Always give the bad news first. Be clear and direct.

Take care of all those around you and the universe will take care of you. Hire smarter people than yourself.

Most importantly, Donald knows that every morning in the jungle a lion awakes knowing that he must run faster than the slowest gazelle. And every gazelle awakens knowing that she must run faster than the fastest lion. Whether a lion or gazelle, you better wake up and run like crazy. And this he does. No one works harder or runs faster than Donald. Standing still is simply not an option.

Ronald Reagan taught us that the best presidents are not always those with the longest resumes, but those who are able to lead, inspire, define the race, recruit a world class team and then set the pace.

I’d like to give you some insight into the Donald Trump you don’t see on TV or read about in his books by sharing two small examples that reveal his heart and compassion. In 1988, Donald invited my son and me to join him and his son at the Tyson-Holmes heavyweight title fight. We arrived in Atlantic City in Donald’s helicopter to a frenzy of paparazzi. We approached the convention center, lights flashing … hundreds of people yelling … everyone fighting for Donald’s attention – a zoo!

As we entered the service entrance amidst this chaos, a doorman called out, “Mr.

Trump.” Donald remembered him and stopped the entire procession. “Hey, Louie, how’s it going,” he asked? They traded small talk, and then Louie thanked Donald for all he had done for his employees and to tell him his son, who was ill, thought he was the greatest man in the world.  Donald grasped his hand, looked him in the eye, and said, “No, Louie, you’re the greatest.”

We got to our seats five minutes before the bell rang to start the fight. The crowd was going nuts. People were tugging at Donald, vying for his attention, but Donald seemed agitated. He asked me for my program.

He wrote out a note and had it hand-deliver it to Louie, inviting him and his son to visit with him the next day. About a decade later, Donald and I sat in the foyer of Frank Campbell Funeral Home awaiting the wake of his father, Fred Trump, the son of immigrants, a carpenter who made the most of the blessings of freedom.

We sat alone, musing about life’s challenges and that, at the end of the day, it is not about accumulating things or fame but about being relevant. In that solemn moment, Donald shared something so simple, yet so resonating and powerful. “Tom,” he said “I think I have the strength of my dad and the sensitivities of my mom. All I want to do now is to take the Trump name and the legacy they built brick by brick and leave it a little bit better than I found it.”

The world is at a tipping point. The old order is crumbling like a house built on shifting sands. Americans will no longer accept those who just talk of change. People understand that we need a battle-hardened CEO with the proven ability of “being” the change to once again jewel the varied and disparate gems of a disenfranchised society back into a seamless necklace of national pride.  He can do this not because the opposition is so bad. But because he is so good.

That is the kind of man Donald Trump is. And, with your help that is the kind of President he will be.

Fran Tarkenton,"The greatest and most revered coaching legend of the National Football League is one Vince Lombardi, Italian-American, tough as nails.

In the 50s, he took over a broken Green Bay Packers football team and made it into a world championship team year after year.

As great as he was, he didn’t always win. There’s a video that’s been out there for years.  It tells the story. Lombardi, fists thrust in the pockets of his heavy wool coat, paces the Lambeau Field sideline, like a caged tiger.

That day, the Packers couldn’t seem to do anything right.

Suddenly Lombardi screams towards his players running off the field, “What the hell’s going on out here?”

Right now, I look around America, and I need to ask: What the hell’s going on here?

The most anemic recovery in modern history. And Washington? It’s broken for everybody – at least for everybody who doesn’t make their living inside the Beltway.

What the hell’s going on here?!

We are stuck, stuck in frustration, mired in anger and fear.

As quarterback, my mission was very simple: to make my teammates better.

Of course, I made a fortune playing football.

My rookie year in professional football, 1961, I was paid $12,500. So I had a second job every off-season.

As a small business owner, I feel connected to the millions of Americans in this vital sector of our economy.

And let’s look at the facts. Small business in America is the heart and soul of equal opportunity.

The facts are that 40 percent of the 530,000 start-ups each month are started by African Americans, Hispanics, or Asians.

Almost a third of small businesses in America are started by immigrants. And nearly 40 percent by women.

But the thing is, small businesses have been surviving not because of government policies, but in spite of them, especially these past eight years.

High taxes.

Strangling regulations.

And practically no access to credit.  So I ask: What the hell’s going on here?   Imagine what could happen in our nation if 27 million job-creating enterprises were suddenly empowered and set free in every neighborhood, to grow and build, and contribute  even more.

I believe it all comes down to leadership.

Whether it’s Vince Lombardi years ago or, Nick Saban of Alabama today, I can tell you in just five simple words what every great leader does.

A leader gets stuff done.

I’ve known Donald Trump for 48 years.

Like those other leaders I’ve known, he gets stuff done.

He is a builder.

He understands that teams win. Individuals don’t.

He builds great teams.

Donald Trump is a proven leader.

A team builder, Donald Trump knows how to get the best out of all people.

I’ve watched him succeed.

I’ve watched him fail.

I’ve watched him get back up. He never quits.

I believe Donald Trump can provide the leadership that will help us all make America great again.

Make it great for everyone.

Let’s go win this game together.  Together, let’s go make America great again.

Thank you. Goodnight.

Tony Perkins,"I am here speaking tonight in my personal capacity and not on behalf of any of the nonprofit organizations that I lead.

We have gathered here in Cleveland to select the Republican nominee for president. We have accomplished that mission. Donald Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party. I will be voting for Donald Trump in November, and I will urge my fellow Americans to do the same.

Allow me to explain why. Tonight we focus on making America one again. In the pledge that we just recited, we said we are one nation under God. Congress added the words “under God” to our pledge of allegiance in 1954.

The context in which those words were added is instructive. The cold war had begun. As a nation, we faced an existential threat. Children practiced the art of duck and cover in classrooms across the country fearing a nuclear attack.

The threats to our nation’s survival were as real then as they are today. The difference is, President Eisenhower knew where to place America’s trust. And upon hearing a sermon Reverend George Docherty delivered, President Eisenhower prompted Congress to adopt the words “under God.”

The Rev. Docherty had pointed to the words of the first Republican PresidentAbraham Lincoln. Speaking to a divided nation at Gettysburg Lincoln said, “under God, this people shall know a new birth of freedom.” A lot has changed since then, but the source of America’s hope and future has not.

It is found in the same place today as it was in 1863 and 1954 – under God.

Our freedom to appeal to and unite under God has been under steady assault. This is why we must stop those in our government and on our courts who have either in principle or in practice attempted to remove these two words, “under God”

and all that they mean from public life.

From his judicial nominees, to his running mate, to the party platform and the policies it promotes, Donald Trump has committed to upholding and protecting this first freedom and therefore our ability as citizens to unite our nation once again under God.

Thank you.
